## How it works

The accordion uses [collapse]({{< docsref "/components/collapse" >}}) internally to make it collapsible.

{{< callout info >}}
{{< partial "callouts/info-prefersreducedmotion.md" >}}
{{< /callout >}}

## Example

Click the accordions below to expand/collapse the accordion content.

To render an accordion that's expanded by default:
- add the `.show` class on the `.accordion-collapse` element.
- drop the `.collapsed` class from the `.accordion-button` element and set its `aria-expanded` attribute to `true`.

<div class="accordion" id="accordionExample">
  <div class="accordion-item">
    <h2 class="accordion-header">
      <button class="accordion-button" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#collapseOne" aria-expanded="true" aria-controls="collapseOne">

      <div class="accordion-body">
        <strong>This is the first item's accordion body.</strong> It is shown by default, until the collapse plugin adds the appropriate classes that we use to style each element. These classes control the overall appearance, as well as the showing and hiding via CSS transitions. You can modify any of this with custom CSS or overriding our default variables. It's also worth noting that just about any HTML can go within the <code>.accordion-body</code>, though the transition does limit overflow.

### Always open

Omit the `data-bs-parent` attribute on each `.accordion-collapse` to make accordion items stay open when another item is opened.

## CSS

### Variables

As part of Boosted's evolving CSS variables approach, accordions now use local CSS variables on `.accordion` for enhanced real-time customization. Values for the CSS variables are set via Sass, so Sass customization is still supported, too.

{{< scss-docs name="accordion-css-vars" file="scss/_accordion.scss" >}}

Small and large accordion modifier classes are used to update the value of these CSS variables as needed:

{{< scss-docs name="accordion-sm-css-vars" file="scss/_accordion.scss" >}}

{{< scss-docs name="accordion-lg-css-vars" file="scss/_accordion.scss" >}}
