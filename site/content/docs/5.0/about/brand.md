Have a need for Boosted's brand resources? Great! We have only a few guidelines we follow, and in turn ask you to follow as well. These guidelines were published by Orange SA on the [Orange Brand website](https://brand.orange.com/guidelines/).


Please refer to our **Design guidelines** to learn about:
- [Orange Master logo]({{< docsref "/guidelines/logos" >}})
- [Orange color palette]({{< docsref "/guidelines/colors" >}})
- [Orange typography]({{< docsref "/guidelines/typography" >}})
- etc.
