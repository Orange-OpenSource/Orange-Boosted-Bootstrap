## Examples

Badges scale to match the size of the immediate parent element by using relative font sizing and `em` units. As of v5, badges no longer have focus or hover styles for links.

### Headings

These variants should not be used because they do not respect the Orange Design System specifications.
</DesignCalloutAlert>

<Example code={`<h1>Example heading <span class="badge text-bg-secondary">New</span></h1>
  <h2>Example heading <span class="badge text-bg-secondary">New</span></h2>
  <h3>Example heading <span class="badge text-bg-secondary">New</span></h3>
  <h4>Example heading <span class="badge text-bg-secondary">New</span></h4>
  <h5>Example heading <span class="badge text-bg-secondary">New</span></h5>
  <h6>Example heading <span class="badge text-bg-secondary">New</span></h6>`} />
</details>

### Buttons

Badges can be used as part of links or buttons to provide a counter.

<Example code={`<button type="button" class="btn btn-primary">
    Notifications <span class="badge text-bg-dark">4</span>
  </button>`} />

Note that depending on how they are used, badges may be confusing for users of screen readers and similar assistive technologies. While the styling of badges provides a visual cue as to their purpose, these users will simply be presented with the content of the badge. Depending on the specific situation, these badges may seem like random additional words or numbers at the end of a sentence, link, or button.

Unless the context is clear (as with the "Notifications" example, where it is understood that the "4" is the number of notifications), consider including additional context with a visually hidden piece of additional text.

### Positioned

Use utilities to modify a `.badge` and position it in the corner of a link with an icon.

<DesignCalloutAlert>
This variant should be used **only** inside a header component.

Please refer to our [Boosted Navbars examples]([[docsref:/examples/navbars]]). You can also refer to the [Global headers guidelines](https://system.design.orange.com/0c1af118d/p/37609b-global-headers/b/366c91) on the Orange Design System website.
</DesignCalloutAlert>

<Example code={`<a href="#" class="position-relative">
    <svg width="2rem" height="2rem" fill="currentColor" aria-hidden="true">
      <use xlink:href="/docs/${getConfig().docs_version}/assets/img/boosted-sprite.svg#buy"/>
    </svg>
    <span class="visually-hidden">Shopping basket</span>
    <span class="position-absolute top-0 start-100 translate-middle badge rounded-pill text-bg-info">
      99+
      <span class="visually-hidden">shopping basket items</span>
    </span>
  </a>`} />

## Background colors

<AddedIn version="5.2.0" />

Set a `background-color` with contrasting foreground `color` with [our `.text-bg-{color}` helpers]([[config:helpers/color-background]]). Previously it was required to manually pair your choice of [`.text-{color}`]([[docsref:/utilities/colors]]) utilities and [`.bg-{color}`]([[docsref:/utilities/background]]) utilities for styling, which you still may use if you prefer.

]} />

## Pill badges

Use the `.rounded-pill` utility class to make badges more rounded with a larger `border-radius`.

Consider using our [Tags component]([[docsref:/components/tags]]) instead.

## CSS

### Variables

<AddedIn version="5.2.0" />

As part of Boosted’s evolving CSS variables approach, badges now use local CSS variables on `.badge` for enhanced real-time customization. Values for the CSS variables are set via Sass, so Sass customization is still supported, too.
