## Example

<Example code={`<div class="sticker">
    <p class="mb-0">
      <span class="sticker-fs-3xl mb-0 d-block">39.99 €</span>
      <span>Per month</span>
    </p>
  </div>`} />

<ScssDocs name="sticker-fs-3xl" file="site/src/scss/_component-examples.scss" />

## How it works

A **sticker** is basically a rounded container. All its content is centered horizontally and vertically.

A max width is set for this content so that it fits easily within the circle.

We provide [a set of stickers examples]([[docsref:/examples/stickers]]) representing several use cases.

<Callout type="warning">
**Positioning**

This flexibility means that the stickers can vary from the design specifications regarding the vertical positioning of content.

For a better rendering you can use our margin utilities or even CSS.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
**Font sizes and responsiveness**

All the provided examples use some specific classes to have non-responsive stickers. You may adapt those classes to your needs.

**Please be aware that those examples are not meant to be responsive** because they will always depend on the context. If you do not want this behavior, you could add some responsive rules by using `scale()` CSS function.
</Callout>

## Sizes

Fancy larger or smaller stickers? Add `.sticker-lg` or `.sticker-sm` for additional sizes.

**Don’t forget to adjust the size of the content.**

<Example code={`<div class="sticker sticker-lg">
    <p class="mb-0">
      <span class="sticker-fs-4xl">New</span>
    </p>
  </div>`} />

<ScssDocs name="sticker-fs-4xl" file="site/src/scss/_component-examples.scss" />

<Example code={`<div class="sticker sticker-sm">
    <p class="mb-0">
      <span class="sticker-fs-xl">New</span>
    </p>
  </div>`} />

<ScssDocs name="sticker-fs-xl" file="site/src/scss/_component-examples.scss" />

## Accessibility

Since stickers only provide a container, accessibility becomes specific to the sticker content:
* [Showing and vocalizing prices](https://a11y-guidelines.orange.com/en/web/components-examples/price-vocalization) can help when stickers contain prices.
* [Accessibility and SVGs](https://a11y-guidelines.orange.com/en/articles/accessible-svg) can help with the SVGs.
* You must semantize the informative content in context with HTML elements, such as `<p>` (as shown in our examples), `<h1>` to `<h6>`, etc.

### Focus on one use case

<Example code={`<div class="sticker">
    <p class="mb-1">
      <span class="sticker-fs-l mb-0 d-block text-decoration-line-through" aria-hidden="true">69.99 €</span>
      <span class="sticker-fs-3xl mb-0 d-block" aria-hidden="true">39.99 €</span>
      <span aria-hidden="true">Per month</span>
      <span class="visually-hidden">39.99 € per month instead of 69.99 €</span>
    </p>
  </div>`} />

## CSS

### Variables

<AddedIn version="5.2.0" />

As part of Boosted’s evolving CSS variables approach, stickers now use local CSS variables on `.sticker` for enhanced real-time customization. Values for the CSS variables are set via Sass, so Sass customization is still supported, too.

<ScssDocs name="sticker-css-vars" file="scss/_sticker.scss" />

Small and large sticker modifier classes are used to update the value of these CSS variables as needed.
