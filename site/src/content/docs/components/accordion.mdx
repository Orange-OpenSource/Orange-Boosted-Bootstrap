## How it works

The accordion uses [collapse]([[docsref:/components/collapse]]) internally to make it collapsible.

<Callout name="info-prefersreducedmotion" />

## Example

Click the accordions below to expand/collapse the accordion content.

To render an accordion that’s expanded by default:
- add the `.show` class on the `.accordion-collapse` element.
- drop the `.collapsed` class from the `.accordion-button` element and set its `aria-expanded` attribute to `true`.

<Example code={`<div class="accordion" id="accordionExample">
    <div class="accordion-item">
      <h2 class="accordion-header">
        <button class="accordion-button" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#collapseOne" aria-expanded="true" aria-controls="collapseOne">
          Accordion Item #1
        </button>
      </h2>
      <div id="collapseOne" class="accordion-collapse collapse show" data-bs-parent="#accordionExample">
        <div class="accordion-body">
          <strong>This is the first item’s accordion body.</strong> It is shown by default, until the collapse plugin adds the appropriate classes that we use to style each element. These classes control the overall appearance, as well as the showing and hiding via CSS transitions. You can modify any of this with custom CSS or overriding our default variables. It’s also worth noting that just about any HTML can go within the <code>.accordion-body</code>, though the transition does limit overflow.
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="accordion-item">
      <h2 class="accordion-header">
        <button class="accordion-button collapsed" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#collapseTwo" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseTwo">

      <div id="collapseTwo" class="accordion-collapse collapse" data-bs-parent="#accordionExample">

### Sizes

Add `.accordion-lg` or `.accordion-sm` for additional sizes.

### Always open

Omit the `data-bs-parent` attribute on each `.accordion-collapse` to make accordion items stay open when another item is opened.

<Example code={`<div class="accordion" id="accordionPanelsStayOpenExample">
    <div class="accordion-item">
      <h2 class="accordion-header">
        <button class="accordion-button" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#panelsStayOpen-collapseOne" aria-expanded="true" aria-controls="panelsStayOpen-collapseOne">

## Accessibility

Please read the [collapse accessibility section]([[docsref:/components/collapse#accessibility]]) for more information.

## CSS

### Variables

<AddedIn version="5.2.0" />

As part of Boosted’s evolving CSS variables approach, accordions now use local CSS variables on `.accordion` for enhanced real-time customization. Values for the CSS variables are set via Sass, so Sass customization is still supported, too.

<ScssDocs name="accordion-css-vars" file="scss/_accordion.scss" />

Small and large accordion modifier classes are used to update the value of these CSS variables as needed:

<ScssDocs name="accordion-sm-css-vars" file="scss/_accordion.scss" />

<ScssDocs name="accordion-lg-css-vars" file="scss/_accordion.scss" />

### Sass variables

<ScssDocs name="accordion-variables" file="scss/_variables.scss" />

## Usage

The collapse plugin utilizes a few classes to handle the heavy lifting:

- `.collapse` hides the content
- `.collapse.show` shows the content
- `.collapsing` is added when the transition starts, and removed when it finishes

These classes can be found in `_transitions.scss`.

### Via data attributes

Just add `data-bs-toggle="collapse"` and a `data-bs-target` to the element to automatically assign control of one or more collapsible elements. The `data-bs-target` attribute accepts a CSS selector to apply the collapse to. Be sure to add the class `collapse` to the collapsible element. If you’d like it to default open, add the additional class `show`.

To add accordion group management to a collapsible area, add the data attribute `data-bs-parent="#selector"`

### Via JavaScript

Enable manually with:

```js
const accordionCollapseElementList = document.querySelectorAll('#myAccordion .collapse')
const accordionCollapseList = [...accordionCollapseElementList].map(accordionCollapseEl => new boosted.Collapse(accordionCollapseEl))
```

### Options

<JsDataAttributes />

<BsTable>
| Name | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
`parent` | selector, DOM element | `null` | If parent is provided, then all collapsible elements under the specified parent will be closed when this collapsible item is shown. (similar to traditional accordion behavior - this is dependent on the `card` class). The attribute has to be set on the target collapsible area. |
`toggle` | boolean | `true` | Toggles the collapsible element on invocation. |
</BsTable>

### Methods

<Callout name="danger-async-methods" type="danger" />

Activates your content as a collapsible element. Accepts an optional options `object`.

You can create a collapse instance with the constructor, for example:

```js
const bsCollapse = new boosted.Collapse('#myCollapse', {
  toggle: false
})
```

<BsTable>
| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `dispose` | Destroys an element’s collapse. (Removes stored data on the DOM element) |
| `getInstance` | Static method which allows you to get the collapse instance associated to a DOM element, you can use it like this: `boosted.Collapse.getInstance(element)`. |
| `getOrCreateInstance` | Static method which returns a collapse instance associated to a DOM element or create a new one in case it wasn’t initialized. You can use it like this: `boosted.Collapse.getOrCreateInstance(element)`. |
| `hide` | Hides a collapsible element. **Returns to the caller before the collapsible element has actually been hidden** (e.g., before the `hidden.bs.collapse` event occurs). |
| `show` | Shows a collapsible element. **Returns to the caller before the collapsible element has actually been shown** (e.g., before the `shown.bs.collapse` event occurs). |
| `toggle` | Toggles a collapsible element to shown or hidden. **Returns to the caller before the collapsible element has actually been shown or hidden** (i.e. before the `shown.bs.collapse` or `hidden.bs.collapse` event occurs). |
</BsTable>

### Events

Boosted’s collapse class exposes a few events for hooking into collapse functionality.

<BsTable>
| Event type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `hide.bs.collapse` | This event is fired immediately when the `hide` method has been called. |
| `hidden.bs.collapse` | This event is fired when a collapse element has been hidden from the user (will wait for CSS transitions to complete). |
| `show.bs.collapse` | This event fires immediately when the `show` instance method is called. |
| `shown.bs.collapse` | This event is fired when a collapse element has been made visible to the user (will wait for CSS transitions to complete). |
</BsTable>

```js
const myCollapsible = document.getElementById('myCollapsible')
myCollapsible.addEventListener('hidden.bs.collapse', event => {
  // do something...
})
```
