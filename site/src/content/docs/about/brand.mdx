<Callout type="info">
Boosted is based on [Bootstrap]([[config:bootstrap]]), which has [its own logo and brand usage guidelines]([[config:bootstrap]]/docs/[[config:docs_version]]/about/brand/).
</Callout>

Have a need for Boosted’s brand resources? Great! We have only a few guidelines we follow, and in turn ask you to follow as well. These guidelines were published by Orange SA on the [Orange Design System website]([[config:ods.web]]).

## Orange logo

<div class="row row-cols-md-2 mt-4 mb-5">
  <div class="col">
    <div class="ratio ratio-1x1">
    <figure class="d-flex bg-black">
      <img src="/docs/[[config:docs_version]]/assets/brand/orange-logo.svg" class="figure-img img-fluid m-auto" width="220" height="220" alt="Orange master logo" loading="lazy" />
      <figcaption class="figure-caption fw-bold position-absolute">Master logo</figcaption>
    </figure>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="col">
    <div class="ratio ratio-1x1">
    <figure class="d-flex bg-black">
      <img src="/docs/[[config:docs_version]]/assets/brand/orange-logo.svg" class="figure-img m-auto" width="30" height="30" alt="Orange small logo" loading="lazy" />
      <figcaption class="figure-caption fw-bold position-absolute">Small logo</figcaption>
    </figure>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

### Responsive SVG

Boosted uses —and recommends to use— **a single SVG file for both logos**, since it’s lightweight and easily made responsive. Here is the unminified SVG content:

<SvgDocs />

## Orange Business Services logo

Orange Business Services has its own logo that contains the Orange logo and the “Business Services” text. This set is a logo by itself, must be considered as a single SVG file and must not be built manually by assembling an image and some texts.

<div class="row row-cols-md-2 mt-4 mb-5">
  <div class="col">
    <div class="ratio ratio-1x1">
    <figure class="d-flex bg-black">
      <img src="/docs/[[config:docs_version]]/assets/brand/OBS-logo.svg" class="figure-img img-fluid m-auto" width="220" height="220" alt="Orange Business Services logo" loading="lazy" />
      <figcaption class="figure-caption fw-bold position-absolute">Orange Business Services logo</figcaption>
    </figure>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<SvgDocs file="OBS-logo" />
