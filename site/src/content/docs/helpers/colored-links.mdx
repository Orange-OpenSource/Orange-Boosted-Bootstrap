## Link colors

Colored links shouldn’t be used in an OUDS Web context.
{/* , please prefer refer to [our links section]([[docsref:/content/typography#links]]) instead */}

<BootstrapCompatibility>
You can use the `.link-*` classes to colorize links. Unlike the [`.text-*` classes]([[docsref:/utilities/colors]]), these classes have a `:hover` and `:focus` state. Some of the link styles use a relatively light foreground color, and should only be used on a dark background in order to have sufficient contrast.

**Heads up!** `.link-body-emphasis` is currently the only colored link that adapts to color modes. It’s treated as a special case until Bootstrap v6 arrives and we can more thoroughly rebuild our theme colors for color modes. Until then, it’s a unique, high-contrast link color with custom `:hover` and `:focus` styles. However, it still responds to the new link utilities.
