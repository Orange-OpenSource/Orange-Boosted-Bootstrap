This standalone version is commonly used for building custom components and should not be used on its own. Remember to provide some sort of accessible name for assistive technologies (for instance, using `aria-labelledby`, a `.visually-hidden`, `aria-label` or a second label). See the [forms overview accessibility]([[docsref:/forms/overview#accessibility]]) section for details.
