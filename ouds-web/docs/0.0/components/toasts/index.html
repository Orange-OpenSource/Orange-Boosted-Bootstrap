        <p>Toasts are lightweight notifications designed to mimic the push notifications that have been popularized by mobile and desktop operating systems. They&rsquo;re built with flexbox, so they&rsquo;re easy to align and position.</p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview <a class="anchor-link" href="#overview" aria-label="Link to this section: Overview"></a></h2>
<p>Things to know when using the toast plugin:</p>
<ul>
<li>Toasts are opt-in for performance reasons, so <strong>you must initialize them yourself</strong>.</li>
<li>Toasts will automatically hide if you do not specify <code>autohide: false</code>.</li>
</ul>
<div class="bd-callout bd-callout-info">
The animation effect of this component is dependent on the <code>prefers-reduced-motion</code> media query. See the <a href="/docs/0.0/getting-started/accessibility/#reduced-motion">reduced motion section of our accessibility documentation</a>.
</div>

<h2 id="examples">Examples <a class="anchor-link" href="#examples" aria-label="Link to this section: Examples"></a></h2>
<h3 id="basic">Basic <a class="anchor-link" href="#basic" aria-label="Link to this section: Basic"></a></h3>
<p>To encourage extensible and predictable toasts, we recommend a header and body. Toast headers use <code>display: flex</code>, allowing easy alignment of content thanks to our margin and flexbox utilities.</p>
<p>Toasts are as flexible as you need and have very little required markup. At a minimum, we require a single element to contain your &ldquo;toasted&rdquo; content and strongly encourage a dismiss button.</p>

Previously, our scripts dynamically added the <code>.hide</code> class to completely hide a toast (with <code>display:none</code>, rather than just with <code>opacity:0</code>). This is now not necessary anymore. However, for backwards compatibility, our script will continue to toggle the class (even though there is no practical need for it) until the next major version.

<p>Customize your toasts by removing sub-components, tweaking them with <a href="/docs/0.0/utilities/api/">utilities</a>, or by adding your own markup. Here we&rsquo;ve created a simpler toast by removing the default <code>.toast-header</code>, adding a custom hide icon from <a href="/docs/0.0/extend/icons/">Solaris</a>, and using some <a href="/docs/0.0/utilities/flex/">flexbox utilities</a> to adjust the layout.</p>

<p>Building on the above example, you can create different toast color schemes with our <a href="/docs/0.0/utilities/colors/">color</a> and <a href="/docs/0.0/utilities/background/">background</a> utilities.

<h2 id="accessibility">Accessibility <a class="anchor-link" href="#accessibility" aria-label="Link to this section: Accessibility"></a></h2>
<p>Toasts are intended to be small interruptions to your visitors or users, so to help those with screen readers and similar assistive technologies, you should wrap your toasts in an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Live_Regions"><code>aria-live</code> region</a>. Changes to live regions (such as injecting/updating a toast component) are automatically announced by screen readers without needing to move the user&rsquo;s focus or otherwise interrupt the user. Additionally, include <code>aria-atomic=&quot;true&quot;</code> to ensure that the entire toast is always announced as a single (atomic) unit, rather than just announcing what was changed (which could lead to problems if you only update part of the toast&rsquo;s content, or if displaying the same toast content at a later point in time). If the information needed is important for the process, e.g. for a list of errors in a form, then use the <a href="/docs/0.0/components/alerts/">alert component</a> instead of toast.</p>
<p>Note that the live region needs to be present in the markup <em>before</em> the toast is generated or updated. If you dynamically generate both at the same time and inject them into the page, they will generally not be announced by assistive technologies.</p>
<p>You also need to adapt the <code>role</code> and <code>aria-live</code> level depending on the content. If it&rsquo;s an important message like an error, use <code>role=&quot;alert&quot; aria-live=&quot;assertive&quot;</code>, otherwise use <code>role=&quot;status&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot;</code> attributes.</p>
<p>As the content you&rsquo;re displaying changes, be sure to update the <a href="#options"><code>delay</code> timeout</a> so that users have enough time to read the toast.</p>

<p>While technically it&rsquo;s possible to add focusable/actionable controls (such as additional buttons or links) in your toast, you should avoid doing this for autohiding toasts. Even if you give the toast a long <a href="#options"><code>delay</code> timeout</a>, keyboard and assistive technology users may find it difficult to reach the toast in time to take action (since toasts don&rsquo;t receive focus when they are displayed). If you absolutely must have further controls, we recommend using a toast with <code>autohide: false</code>.</p>

<h3 id="variables">Variables <a class="anchor-link" href="#variables" aria-label="Link to this section: Variables"></a></h3>
<p>As part of OUDS Web&rsquo;s evolving CSS variables approach, toasts now use local CSS variables on <code>.toast</code> for enhanced real-time customization. Values for the CSS variables are set via Sass, so Sass customization is still supported, too.</p>

<p>Tooltips on close buttons of toasts have to be initialized. <a href="/docs/0.0/components/tooltips/#enable-tooltips">Tooltips can be initialized globally</a> in the project.</p>
<h3 id="options">Options <a class="anchor-link" href="#options" aria-label="Link to this section: Options"></a></h3>
<p>As options can be passed via data attributes or JavaScript, you can append an option name to <code>data-bs-</code>, as in <code>data-bs-animation=&quot;{value}&quot;</code>. Make sure to change the case type of the option name from &ldquo;<em>camelCase</em>&rdquo; to &ldquo;<em>kebab-case</em>&rdquo; when passing the options via data attributes. For example, use <code>data-bs-custom-class=&quot;beautifier&quot;</code> instead of <code>data-bs-customClass=&quot;beautifier&quot;</code>.</p>
<p>As of OUDS Web 5.2.0, all components support an <strong>experimental</strong> reserved data attribute <code>data-bs-config</code> that can house simple component configuration as a JSON string. When an element has <code>data-bs-config='{&quot;delay&quot;:0, &quot;title&quot;:123}'</code> and <code>data-bs-title=&quot;456&quot;</code> attributes, the final <code>title</code> value will be <code>456</code> and the separate data attributes will override values given on <code>data-bs-config</code>. In addition, existing data attributes are able to house JSON values like <code>data-bs-delay='{&quot;show&quot;:0,&quot;hide&quot;:150}'</code>.</p>
<p>The final configuration object is the merged result of <code>data-bs-config</code>, <code>data-bs-</code>, and <code>js object</code> where the latest given key-value overrides the others.</p>

<strong>All API methods are asynchronous and start a transition.</strong> They return to the caller as soon as the transition is started, but before it ends. In addition, a method call on a transitioning component will be ignored. <a href="/docs/0.0/getting-started/javascript/#asynchronous-functions-and-transitions">Learn more in our JavaScript docs.</a>

<td><code>dispose</code></td>
<td>Hides an element&rsquo;s toast. Your toast will remain on the DOM but won&rsquo;t show anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>getInstance</code></td>
<td><em>Static</em> method which allows you to get the toast instance associated with a DOM element. <br> For example: <code>const myToastEl = document.getElementById('myToastEl')</code> <code>const myToast = boosted.Toast.getInstance(myToastEl)</code> Returns a OUDS Web toast instance.</td>

<td><code>getOrCreateInstance</code></td>
<td><em>Static</em> method which allows you to get the toast instance associated with a DOM element, or create a new one, in case it wasn&rsquo;t initialized. <br><code>const myToastEl = document.getElementById('myToastEl')</code> <code>const myToast = boosted.Toast.getOrCreateInstance(myToastEl)</code> Returns a OUDS Web toast instance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>hide</code></td>
<td>Hides an element&rsquo;s toast. <strong>Returns to the caller before the toast has actually been hidden</strong> (i.e. before the <code>hidden.bs.toast</code> event occurs). You have to manually call this method if you made <code>autohide</code> to <code>false</code>.</td>
