<strong>Accessibility tip:</strong> Using color to add meaning only provides a visual indication, which will not be conveyed to users of assistive technologies like screen readers. Please ensure the meaning is obvious from the content itself (e.g., the visible text with a <a href="/docs/0.1/getting-started/accessibility/#color-contrast"><em>sufficient</em> color contrast</a>) or is included through alternative means, such as additional text hidden with the <code>.visually-hidden</code> class.

<p>Background utilities like <code>.bg-*</code> are generated from our original <code>$theme-colors</code> Sass map and respond to color modes.</p>
<p>Similar to the contextual text color classes, set the background of an element to any contextual class. Background utilities <strong>do not set <code>color</code></strong>, so depending on the cases you&rsquo;ll want to use:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>.text-*</code> <a href="/docs/0.1/utilities/colors/">color utilities</a> when the background color remains the same in light and dark mode</li>
<li><code>.text-bg-*</code> <a href="/docs/0.1/helpers/color-background/">color &amp; background helper</a> from our <a href="/docs/0.1/customize/color-theme/#theming">theme colors</a></li>
<li><code>[data-bs-theme]</code> <a href="/docs/0.1/customize/color-modes/#example">color mode attribute</a> when the element using a background utility contains complex sub-elements such as components that need to respond to color modes</li>

<p>In Bootstrap, for each <code>.bg-*</code> there is a matching <code>.bg-*-subtle</code> utility responding to color modes. In OUDS Web, subtle colors don&rsquo;t exist so these background utilities have exactly the same value and shouldn&rsquo;t be used. Prefer the regular <code>.bg-*</code> utilities instead.</p>

<h2 id="opacity">Opacity <a class="anchor-link" href="#opacity" aria-label="Link to this section: Opacity"></a></h2>
<p>As of v5.1.0, <code>background-color</code> utilities are generated with Sass using CSS variables. This allows for real-time color changes without compilation and dynamic alpha transparency changes.</p>
<h3 id="how-it-works">How it works <a class="anchor-link" href="#how-it-works" aria-label="Link to this section: How it works"></a></h3>
<p>Consider our default <code>.bg-success</code> utility.</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>We use an RGB version of our <code>--bs-success</code> (with the value of <code>25, 135, 84</code>) CSS variable and attached a second CSS variable, <code>--bs-bg-opacity</code>, for the alpha transparency (with a default value <code>1</code> thanks to a local CSS variable). That means anytime you use <code>.bg-success</code> now, your computed <code>color</code> value is <code>rgba(25, 135, 84, 1)</code>. The local CSS variable inside each <code>.bg-*</code> class avoids inheritance issues so nested instances of the utilities don&rsquo;t automatically have a modified alpha transparency.</p>
<h3 id="example">Example <a class="anchor-link" href="#example" aria-label="Link to this section: Example"></a></h3>
