## Release v

- [ ] `npm run release-version $current_version $next_version` to bump version number
  - then, if bumping a minor or major version:
    - [ ] Manually search and replace `$current_version` in all files, meaning changes should happen in:
      - [ ] The style sheet loaded in `.storybook/preview-head.html`
      - [ ] Some download links in the `README.md`
      - [ ] `docs_version` in `config.yml` and other references to the previous version
      - [ ] `VERSION` in `js/src/base-component.js`
      - [ ] `version` in `package.js`
      - [ ] `version_short` in `package.json`
      - [ ] `scss/mixins/_banner.scss`
      - [ ] `scss/docs.scss`
      - [ ] Several markdown files and markdown extended files
      - [ ] Add docs version to `site/data/docs-versions.yml`
      - [ ] Update the home news for the next release
      - [ ] Move `site/content/docs/x.y` to `site/content/docs/x.y+1`
      - [ ] Move `site/static/docs/x.y` to `site/static/docs/x.y+1`
      - [ ] Make sure the migration guide is updated only for the next version
      - [ ] (Major version) Manually update the version in `nuget/ouds-web.nuspec` and `nuget/ouds-web.sass.nuspec`
      - [ ] Check that the changes in the migration guide only apply to the latest version
  - check wrong matches in `CHANGELOG.md`, and maybe `site/content/docs/<version>/migration.md`
  - :warning: check the `package-lock.json` and `package.json` content, only "@ouds/web" should have its version changed!
- [ ] if the year changed recently, happy new year :tada: but please change © year in `.scss` main files (reboot, grid, utilities, and main file) as well as in `NOTICE.txt`.
- [ ] `npm run release` to compile dist, build Storybook, update SRI hashes in doc, and package the release
- [ ] Prepare changelog:
  - install [Conventional Changelog](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog) and `conventional-changelog-cli` globally
  - run `conventional-changelog -p angular -i CHANGELOG.md -s`
  - [ ] Make sure to import all the bad named commits
- [ ] Commit and push `dist` with a `chore(release): vx.y.z` commit message
- [ ] Merge on `ouds/main`
- [ ] Tag your version, and push your tag using `git tag vx.y.z-ouds-web` and `git push vx.y.z-ouds-web`
- [ ] Pack and publish
  - `npm pack`
  - if you are already logged in to NPM (with a personal account, for example), [you'd better use a repository scoped `.npmrc` file](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30114166/how-to-have-multiple-npm-users-set-up-locally)
  - Publish:
    - if you're releasing a pre-release, use `--tag`, e.g. for v1-alpha1 `npm publish ouds-web-1.0.0-alpha1.tgz --tag next`
    - `npm publish`
    <!-- When there is several branches to maintain
    - (v4 only) `npm publish --tag v4.x.y` (if you forgot and v4 becomes the latest version on NPM, you can run `npm dist-tag add boosted@5.x.y latest` to fix it) -->
- [ ] check release on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ouds/web), [Nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/@ouds/web/), [Packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/orange-opensource/orange-boosted-bootstrap)…
- [ ] publish documentation on `main` of the [ouds-web-doc](https://github.com/Orange-OpenSource/ouds-web-doc) repo:
  - [ ] copy `../_site` to the `main` branch
  - [ ] don't forget to update Storybook as well and double-check that pages are referenced
  - [ ] check every `index.html` used as redirections to redirect to the new release
  - [ ] when bumping minor or major version: ensure `dist` URLs in examples' HTML has changed
  - [ ] double-check everything before pushing, starting by searching for forgotten old version number occurrences
  - [ ] Make the new release banner appears in the previous version of the doc (e.g. in v5.3 when releasing the v5.4.0 doc)
<!-- When there is a v1 released
- [ ] make an announcement in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/Orange-OpenSource/Orange-Boosted-Bootstrap/discussions/categories/announcements) (+ pin the new GH Discussion) -->
- [ ] [create a GitHub release](https://github.com/Orange-OpenSource/Orange-Boosted-Bootstrap/releases/new):
  - attach the 2 zip files
  - paste the CHANGELOG / Ship list in the release's description
<!-- When there is a v1 released
- [ ] make an announcement on internal communication channels :tada: -->
- [ ] [publish on Nuget](https://github.com/Orange-OpenSource/Orange-Boosted-Bootstrap/wiki/Generate-NuGet-packages)
