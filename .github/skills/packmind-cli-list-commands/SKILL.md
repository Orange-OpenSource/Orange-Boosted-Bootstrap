# Packmind CLI List Commands

List available Packmind artifacts (standards, commands, skills, packages) via the CLI.

## IMPORTANT: Output Requirements

When presenting results to the user, you MUST:
1. **Run the CLI command** using the Bash tool
2. **Preserve the full URLs** from the CLI output - these are clickable links to the Packmind webapp
3. **Display results as a list** showing slug, name, and the full URL for each item
4. **Never summarize or table-ify** the output in a way that hides the URLs

Example output format to show the user:
```
## Standards (3)

- **my-standard-slug**
  Name: My Standard Name
  Link: https://<host>/org/myorg/space/global/standards/abc123/summary

- **another-standard**
  Name: Another Standard
  Link: https://<host>/org/myorg/space/global/standards/def456/summary
```
