  - iOS Safari
  - Chrome & Firefox on Android
- [ ] Including RTL mode;
- [ ] Ask for reviews and accessibility testing;
- [ ] [sync with Bootstrap](https://github.com/Orange-OpenSource/Orange-Boosted-Bootstrap/wiki/Syncing-with-Bootstrap)'s release and probably wait for it;
- [ ] `npm run release-version $current_version $next_version` to bump version number
  - then, if bumping a minor or major version:
    - [ ] Manually change `version_short` in `package.json`
    - [ ] Add docs version to `site/data/docs-versions.yml`
    - [ ] Manually change `docs_version` in `hugo.yml` and other references to the previous version
    - [ ] Update redirects in docs frontmatter (`site/src/content/docs/_index.html`?)
    - [ ] Move `site/src/content/docs/5.x` to `site/src/content/docs/5.x+1`
    - [ ] Increment `site/static/docs/{version}` version
    - [ ] Increment version in `nuget/boosted.nuspec`
    - [ ] (Major version) Manually update the version in `nuget/boosted.nuspec` and `nuget/boosted.sass.nuspec`
  - check wrong matches in `CHANGELOG.md`, and maybe `site/src/content/docs/<version>/migration.md`
  - :warning: check the `package-lock.json` and `package.json` content, only "boosted" should have its version changed!
  - :warning: `site/src/content/docs/5.1/**/*.md` should not always be modified
- [ ] if the year changed recently, happy new year :tada: but please change © year in `.scss` main files (reboot, grid, utilities, and main file) as well as in `NOTICE.txt`.
- [ ] `npm run release` to compile dist, build Storybook, update SRI hashes in doc, and package the release
- [ ] Prepare changelog:
  - install [Conventionnal Changelog](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog) and `conventional-changelog-cli` globally
  - run `conventional-changelog -p angular -i CHANGELOG.md -s`
  - and probably maintain [a ship list (e.g. for v4.4.0)](https://github.com/Orange-OpenSource/Orange-Boosted-Bootstrap/issues/226)
- [ ] Commit and push `dist` with a `chore(release)` commit message
- [ ] Manually run BrowserStack test
- [ ] Manually run Percy test
- [ ] Merge (on `v4-dev` or `main`)
- [ ] Tag your version, and push your tag
- [ ] Pack and publish
  - `npm pack`
  - if you are already logged in to NPM (with a personal account, for example), [you’d better use a repository scoped `.npmrc` file](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30114166/how-to-have-multiple-npm-users-set-up-locally)
  - Publish:
    - if you’re releasing a pre-release, use `--tag`, e.g. for v5-alpha1 `npm publish boosted-5.0.0-alpha1.tgz --tag next`
    - (v4 only) `npm publish --tag v4.x.y` (if you forgot and v4 becomes the latest version on NPM, you can run `npm dist-tag add boosted@5.x.y latest to fix it)
    - (v5 only) `npm publish`
- [ ] check release on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/boosted), [Nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/boosted/), [Packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/orange-opensource/orange-boosted-bootstrap)…
- [ ] publish documentation on `gh-pages`:
  - [ ] copy `../_site` to the `gh-pages` branch (don’t forget to update Storybook as well)
  - [ ] check every `index.html` used as redirections to redirect to the new release
  - [ ] when bumping minor version: ensure `dist` URLs in examples’ HTML has changed
  - [ ] double-check everything before pushing, starting by searching for forgotten old version number occurrences
- [ ] make an announcement in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/Orange-OpenSource/Orange-Boosted-Bootstrap/discussions/categories/announcements) (+ pin the new GH Discussion)
- [ ] [create a GitHub release](https://github.com/Orange-OpenSource/Orange-Boosted-Bootstrap/releases/new):
  - attach the zip file
  - paste the CHANGELOG / Ship list in the release’s description
- [ ] make an announcement on internal communication channels :tada:
- [ ] [publish on Nuget](https://github.com/Orange-OpenSource/Orange-Boosted-Bootstrap/wiki/Generate-NuGet-packages)
