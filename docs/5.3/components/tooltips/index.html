<p>Things to know when using the tooltip plugin:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tooltips rely on the third party library <a href="https://popper.js.org/docs/v2/">Popper</a> for positioning. You must include <a href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@popperjs/core@2.11.8/dist/umd/popper.min.js">popper.min.js</a> before <code>boosted.js</code>, or use one <code>boosted.bundle.min.js</code> which contains Popper.</li>
<li>Tooltips are opt-in for performance reasons, so <strong>you must initialize them yourself</strong>.</li>
<li>Tooltips with zero-length titles are never displayed.</li>
<li>Specify <code>container: &#39;body&#39;</code> to avoid rendering problems in more complex components (like our input groups, button groups, etc).</li>
<li>Triggering tooltips on hidden elements will not work.</li>
<li>Tooltips for <code>.disabled</code> or <code>disabled</code> elements must be triggered on a wrapper element.</li>
<li>When triggered from hyperlinks that span multiple lines, tooltips will be centered. Use <code>white-space: nowrap;</code> on your <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>s to avoid this behavior.</li>
<li>Tooltips must be hidden before their corresponding elements have been removed from the DOM.</li>
<li>Tooltips can be triggered thanks to an element inside a shadow DOM.</li>
</ul>
<p>Got all that? Great, let’s see how they work with some examples.</p>
<div class="bd-callout bd-callout-info"> <p>By default, this component uses the built-in content sanitizer, which strips out any HTML elements that are not explicitly allowed. See the <a href="/docs/5.3/getting-started/javascript/#sanitizer">sanitizer section in our JavaScript documentation</a> for more details.</p> </div>
<div class="bd-callout bd-callout-info"> <p>The animation effect of this component is dependent on the <code>prefers-reduced-motion</code> media query. See the <a href="/docs/5.3/getting-started/accessibility/#reduced-motion">reduced motion section of our accessibility documentation</a>.</p> </div>
<h2 id="accessibility">Accessibility<a class="anchor-link" aria-label="Link to this section: Accessibility" href="#accessibility"> </a></h2>
<p>For accessibility purpose, <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/content-on-hover-or-focus.html">content on hover or focus should be dismissible, hoverable and persistent</a>.
With Boosted tooltips, no mechanism is available to dismiss the tooltip without moving pointer hover or keyboard focus (due to Popper library’s limitations).
Please pay attention that the tooltip never hides an important content.</p>
<h2 id="examples">Examples<a class="anchor-link" aria-label="Link to this section: Examples" href="#examples"> </a></h2>
<h3 id="enable-tooltips">Enable tooltips<a class="anchor-link" aria-label="Link to this section: Enable tooltips" href="#enable-tooltips"> </a></h3>
<p>As mentioned above, you must initialize tooltips before they can be used. One way to initialize all tooltips on a page would be to select them by their <code>data-bs-toggle</code> attribute, like so:</p>
<script type="module" src="/docs/5.3/assets/Code.astro_astro_type_script_index_0_lang.DNPzYkau.js"></script> <div class="bd-code-snippet">  <div class="highlight"> <pre class="language-js"><code is:raw class="language-js"><span class="token keyword">const</span> tooltipTriggerList <span class="token operator">=</span> document<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">querySelectorAll</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">&#39;[data-bs-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot;]&#39;</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span>

<p>The required markup for a tooltip is only a <code>data</code> attribute and <code>title</code> on the HTML element you wish to have a tooltip. The generated markup of a tooltip is rather simple, though it does require a position (by default, set to <code>top</code> by the plugin).</p>
<div class="bd-callout bd-callout-warning"> <p><strong>Keep tooltips accessible to keyboard and assistive technology users</strong> by only adding them to HTML elements that are traditionally keyboard-focusable and interactive (such as links or form controls). While other HTML elements can be made focusable by adding <code>tabindex=&quot;0&quot;</code>, this can create annoying and confusing tab stops on non-interactive elements for keyboard users, and most assistive technologies currently do not announce tooltips in this situation. Additionally, do not rely solely on <code>hover</code> as the trigger for your tooltips as this will make them impossible to trigger for keyboard users.</p> </div>

<p>As options can be passed via data attributes or JavaScript, you can append an option name to <code>data-bs-</code>, as in <code>data-bs-animation=&quot;{value}&quot;</code>. Make sure to change the case type of the option name from “<em>camelCase</em>” to “<em>kebab-case</em>” when passing the options via data attributes. For example, use <code>data-bs-custom-class=&quot;beautifier&quot;</code> instead of <code>data-bs-customClass=&quot;beautifier&quot;</code>.</p>
<p>As of Boosted 5.2.0, all components support an <strong>experimental</strong> reserved data attribute <code>data-bs-config</code> that can house simple component configuration as a JSON string. When an element has <code>data-bs-config=&#39;{&quot;delay&quot;:0, &quot;title&quot;:123}&#39;</code> and <code>data-bs-title=&quot;456&quot;</code> attributes, the final <code>title</code> value will be <code>456</code> and the separate data attributes will override values given on <code>data-bs-config</code>. In addition, existing data attributes are able to house JSON values like <code>data-bs-delay=&#39;{&quot;show&quot;:0,&quot;hide&quot;:150}&#39;</code>.</p>
<p>The final configuration object is the merged result of <code>data-bs-config</code>, <code>data-bs-</code>, and <code>js object</code> where the latest given key-value overrides the others.</p>

By default, it’s <code>&#39;clippingParents&#39;</code> and can accept an HTMLElement reference (via JavaScript only). For more information refer to Popper’s <a href="https://popper.js.org/docs/v2/utils/detect-overflow/#boundary">detectOverflow docs</a>.</td></tr><tr><td><code>container</code></td><td>string, element, false</td><td><code>false</code></td><td>Appends the tooltip to a specific element. Example: <code>container: &#39;body&#39;</code>. This option is particularly useful in that it allows you to position the tooltip in the flow of the document near the triggering element - which will prevent the tooltip from floating away from the triggering element during a window resize.</td></tr><tr><td><code>customClass</code></td><td>string, function</td><td><code>&#39;&#39;</code></td><td>Add classes to the tooltip when it is shown. Note that these classes will be added in addition to any classes specified in the template. To add multiple classes, separate them with spaces: <code>&#39;class-1 class-2&#39;</code>. You can also pass a function that should return a single string containing additional class names.</td></tr><tr><td><code>delay</code></td><td>number, object</td><td><code>0</code></td><td>Delay showing and hiding the tooltip (ms)—doesn’t apply to manual trigger type. If a number is supplied, delay is applied to both hide/show.

You can pass a string in data attributes with comma separated values like: <code>data-bs-offset=&quot;10,20&quot;</code>. When a function is used to determine the offset, it is called with an object containing the popper placement, the reference, and popper rects as its first argument. The triggering element DOM node is passed as the second argument. The function must return an array with two numbers: <a href="https://popper.js.org/docs/v2/modifiers/offset/#skidding-1">skidding</a>, <a href="https://popper.js.org/docs/v2/modifiers/offset/#distance-1">distance</a>.

When <code>auto</code> is specified, it will dynamically reorient the tooltip. When a function is used to determine the placement, it is called with the tooltip DOM node as its first argument and the triggering element DOM node as its second. The <code>this</code> context is set to the tooltip instance.</td></tr><tr><td><code>popperConfig</code></td><td>null, object, function</td><td><code>null</code></td><td>To change Boosted’s default Popper config, see <a href="https://popper.js.org/docs/v2/constructors/#options">Popper’s configuration</a>. When a function is used to create the Popper configuration, it’s called with an object that contains the Boosted’s default Popper configuration. It helps you use and merge the default with your own configuration. The function must return a configuration object for Popper.</td></tr><tr><td><code>sanitize</code></td><td>boolean</td><td><code>true</code></td><td>Enable <a href="/docs/5.3/getting-started/javascript#sanitizer">content sanitization</a>.
