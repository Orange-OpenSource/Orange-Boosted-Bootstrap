<p>Offcanvas is a sidebar component that can be toggled via JavaScript to appear from the left, right, top or bottom edge of the viewport. Buttons or anchors are used as triggers that are attached to specific elements you toggle, and <code>data</code> attributes are used to invoke our JavaScript.</p>
<ul>
<li>Offcanvas shares some of the same JavaScript code as modals. Conceptually, they are quite similar, but they are separate plugins.</li>
<li>Similarly, some <a href="#sass-variables">source Sass</a> variables for offcanvas’s styles and dimensions are inherited from the modal’s variables.</li>
<li>When shown, offcanvas includes a default backdrop that can be clicked to hide the offcanvas.</li>
<li>Similar to modals, only one offcanvas can be shown at a time.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Heads up!</strong> Given how CSS handles animations, you cannot use <code>margin</code> or <code>translate</code> on an <code>.offcanvas</code> element. Instead, use the class as an independent wrapping element.</p>
<div class="bd-callout bd-callout-info"> <p>The animation effect of this component is dependent on the <code>prefers-reduced-motion</code> media query. See the <a href="/docs/5.3/getting-started/accessibility/#reduced-motion">reduced motion section of our accessibility documentation</a>.</p> </div>

<p>Below is an offcanvas example that is shown by default (via <code>.show</code> on <code>.offcanvas</code>). Offcanvas includes support for a header with a close button and an optional body class for some initial <code>padding</code>. We suggest that you include offcanvas headers with dismiss actions whenever possible, or provide an explicit dismiss action.</p>

<p>Use the buttons below to show and hide an offcanvas element via JavaScript that toggles the <code>.show</code> class on an element with the <code>.offcanvas</code> class.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>.offcanvas</code> hides content (default)</li>
<li><code>.offcanvas.show</code> shows content</li>
</ul>
<p>You can use a link with the <code>href</code> attribute, or a button with the <code>data-bs-target</code> attribute. In both cases, the <code>data-bs-toggle=&quot;offcanvas&quot;</code> is required.</p>

<div class="bd-callout bd-callout-warning"> <p> <strong>Heads up!</strong> Dark variants for components are deprecated in Boosted v5.3.3. They are replaced by our contextual
    dark mode.<br><br>Add <code>data-bs-theme="dark"</code> to the <code>.offcanvas</code> or any ancestor element
    to enable a component-specific color mode. <a href="/docs/customize/color-modes">Learn more about our color modes</a>.

<!-- Boosted mod: use tag component --><p><span class="tag tag-sm">Added in v5.2.0</span></p>
<p>Responsive offcanvas classes hide content outside the viewport from a specified breakpoint and down. Above that breakpoint, the contents within will behave as usual. For example, <code>.offcanvas-lg</code> hides content in an offcanvas below the <code>lg</code> breakpoint, but shows the content above the <code>lg</code> breakpoint. Responsive offcanvas classes are available across for each breakpoint.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>.offcanvas</code></li>
<li><code>.offcanvas-sm</code></li>
<li><code>.offcanvas-md</code></li>
<li><code>.offcanvas-lg</code></li>
<li><code>.offcanvas-xl</code></li>
<li><code>.offcanvas-xxl</code></li>
</ul>
<p>To make a responsive offcanvas, replace the <code>.offcanvas</code> base class with a responsive variant and ensure your close button has an explicit <code>data-bs-target</code>.</p>

<p>There’s no default placement for offcanvas components, so you must add one of the modifier classes below.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>.offcanvas-start</code> places offcanvas on the left of the viewport (shown above)</li>
<li><code>.offcanvas-end</code> places offcanvas on the right of the viewport</li>
<li><code>.offcanvas-top</code> places offcanvas on the top of the viewport</li>
<li><code>.offcanvas-bottom</code> places offcanvas on the bottom of the viewport</li>
</ul>

<p>Since the offcanvas panel is conceptually a modal dialog, be sure to add <code>aria-labelledby=&quot;...&quot;</code>—referencing the offcanvas title—to <code>.offcanvas</code>. Note that you don’t need to add <code>role=&quot;dialog&quot;</code> since we already add it via JavaScript.</p>

<p>As part of Bootstrap’s evolving CSS variables approach, offcanvas now uses local CSS variables on <code>.offcanvas</code> for enhanced real-time customization. Values for the CSS variables are set via Sass, so Sass customization is still supported, too.</p>

<p>The offcanvas plugin utilizes a few classes and attributes to handle the heavy lifting:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>.offcanvas</code> hides the content</li>
<li><code>.offcanvas.show</code> shows the content</li>
<li><code>.offcanvas-start</code> hides the offcanvas on the left</li>
<li><code>.offcanvas-end</code> hides the offcanvas on the right</li>
<li><code>.offcanvas-top</code> hides the offcanvas on the top</li>
<li><code>.offcanvas-bottom</code> hides the offcanvas on the bottom</li>
</ul>
<p>Add a dismiss button with the <code>data-bs-dismiss=&quot;offcanvas&quot;</code> attribute, which triggers the JavaScript functionality. Be sure to use the <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> element with it for proper behavior across all devices.</p>

<p>Add <code>data-bs-toggle=&quot;offcanvas&quot;</code> and a <code>data-bs-target</code> or <code>href</code> to the element to automatically assign control of one offcanvas element. The <code>data-bs-target</code> attribute accepts a CSS selector to apply the offcanvas to. Be sure to add the class <code>offcanvas</code> to the offcanvas element. If you’d like it to default open, add the additional class <code>show</code>.</p>

<h3>Enable tooltip on close button</h3><p>
Tooltips on close buttons&#x20;of&#x20;offcanvases&#x20;have to be initialized.
<a href="/docs/5.3/components/tooltips/#enable-tooltips">Tooltips can be initialized globally</a>
in the project.

<h3 id="options">Options<a class="anchor-link" href="#options"><span class="visually-hidden">Link to this section: Options</span></a></h3>
<p>As options can be passed via data attributes or JavaScript, you can append an option name to <code>data-bs-</code>, as in <code>data-bs-animation=&quot;{value}&quot;</code>. Make sure to change the case type of the option name from “<em>camelCase</em>” to “<em>kebab-case</em>” when passing the options via data attributes. For example, use <code>data-bs-custom-class=&quot;beautifier&quot;</code> instead of <code>data-bs-customClass=&quot;beautifier&quot;</code>.</p>
<p>As of Boosted 5.2.0, all components support an <strong>experimental</strong> reserved data attribute <code>data-bs-config</code> that can house simple component configuration as a JSON string. When an element has <code>data-bs-config=&#39;{&quot;delay&quot;:0, &quot;title&quot;:123}&#39;</code> and <code>data-bs-title=&quot;456&quot;</code> attributes, the final <code>title</code> value will be <code>456</code> and the separate data attributes will override values given on <code>data-bs-config</code>. In addition, existing data attributes are able to house JSON values like <code>data-bs-delay=&#39;{&quot;show&quot;:0,&quot;hide&quot;:150}&#39;</code>.</p>
<p>The final configuration object is the merged result of <code>data-bs-config</code>, <code>data-bs-</code>, and <code>js object</code> where the latest given key-value overrides the others.</p>
