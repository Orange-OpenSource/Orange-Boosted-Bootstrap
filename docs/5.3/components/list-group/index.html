<p>Use <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>s or <code>&lt;button&gt;</code>s to create <em>actionable</em> list group items with hover, disabled, and active states by adding <code>.list-group-item-action</code>. We separate these pseudo-classes to ensure list groups made of non-interactive elements (like <code>&lt;li&gt;</code>s or <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s) don’t provide a click or tap affordance.</p>
<p>Make <code>.list-group-item-action</code> instances <em>appear</em> disabled by adding <code>.disabled</code>, and <code>aria-disabled=&quot;true&quot;</code> to inform assistive technologies that the element is disabled. You may require additional JavaScript to fully disable links and buttons.</p>
<p>Be sure to <strong>not use the standard <code>.btn</code> classes here</strong>.</p>

<p>Add the <code>.list-group-numbered</code> modifier class (and optionally use an <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code> element) to opt into numbered list group items. Numbers are generated via CSS (as opposed to a <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code>s default browser styling) for better placement inside list group items and to allow for better customization.</p>
<p>Numbers are generated by <code>counter-reset</code> on the <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code>, and then styled and placed with a <code>::before</code> pseudo-element on the <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> with <code>counter-increment</code> and <code>content</code>.</p>

<p>Add <code>.list-group-horizontal</code> to change the layout of list group items from vertical to horizontal across all breakpoints. Alternatively, choose a responsive variant <code>.list-group-horizontal-{sm|md|lg|xl|xxl}</code> to make a list group horizontal starting at that breakpoint’s <code>min-width</code>. Currently <strong>horizontal list groups cannot be combined with flush list groups.</strong></p>

    dark mode.<br><br>Add <code>data-bs-theme="dark"</code> to the <code>.list-group</code> or any ancestor element

<!-- Boosted mod: use tag component --><p><span class="tag tag-sm">Added in v5.2.0</span></p>
<p>As part of Boosted’s evolving CSS variables approach, list groups now use local CSS variables on <code>.list-group</code> for enhanced real-time customization. Values for the CSS variables are set via Sass, so Sass customization is still supported, too.</p>
