<hr class="mb-4">
<p>Boosted v5.3.3 has landed also including specific Boosted content as usual.</p>
<p>If you need more details about the changes, please refer to the <a href="https://github.com/Orange-OpenSource/Orange-Boosted-Bootstrap/releases/tag/v5.3.3">v5.3.3 release</a>.</p>
<h3 id="dark-mode">Dark mode! <a class="anchor-link" href="#dark-mode" aria-label="Link to this section: Dark mode!"></a></h3>
<p>Bootstrap introduced the inner color modes mechanism in v5.3.0. <strong>The dark mode was not yet available in the Orange Design System specifications at this time, but is now available since v5.3.3!</strong></p>
<p>Learn more by reading the new <a href="/docs/5.3/customize/color-modes/">color modes documentation</a>.</p>
<p>This change has an impact on how you should use Boosted. Please read carefully the following notes.</p>
<p>From a general point of view, the dark mode is optional on Orange websites. However, a new concept has been introduced and replaces our dark variants for components. It is referred to as &ldquo;contextual dark mode&rdquo; and is based on the <code>data-bs-theme=&quot;dark&quot;</code> attribute. It is used to switch a component or a container to dark mode, independently of the global color mode. It implies that all the <code>.{component}-dark</code> classes have been removed from Boosted and that <code>${component}-*-inverted</code> Sass variables have been deprecated.</p>
<p>Please note that <code>data-bs-theme</code> (default, light or dark) automatically sets the <code>color</code> and <code>background-color</code> CSS properties to <code>inherit</code> on the element it is applied to. This means that some of our components have been adapted to this new behavior by setting their default colors and background colors differently (some of them are not transparent). Please double-check that it doesn&rsquo;t break your design. And more generally, please check carefully that this new version doesn&rsquo;t break your design even if you didn&rsquo;t use the dark variants before.</p>
<p>The use of colors have been revamped to be more consistent and easier to use. During the process, some colors have been modified in light mode to be darker and ensure a better contrast: primary, success and info.</p>
<p>All our helpers and utilities have also been adapted to the new color modes mechanism and automatically switch their colors and background colors depending on the current color mode.
As a result, you should for instance now rather use <code>.text-bg-{color}</code> classes instead of <code>.bg-{color}</code> classes when possible for automatic contrast.</p>
<p>Retrieve our color palette in the <a href="/docs/5.3/customize/color-palette/">new color palette documentation</a>.</p>
<p>Retrieve our color theme in the <a href="/docs/5.3/customize/color-theme/">new color theme documentation</a> that gathers the useful CSS variables switching between light and dark mode.</p>

Color mode mechanism coming from Bootstrap is available from Boosted v5.3.0. However, the dark mode was not yet available in the Orange Design System specifications at this time. <strong>Please use at least Boosted v5.3.3 to have the dark mode available.</strong>

<p><strong>Global support for light (default) and dark color modes.</strong> Set color mode globally on the <code>:root</code> element, on groups of elements and components with a wrapper class, or directly on components, with <code>data-bs-theme=&quot;light|dark&quot;</code>. Also included is a new <code>color-mode()</code> mixin that can output a ruleset with the <code>data-bs-theme</code> selector or a media query, depending on your preference.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>New extended color system.</strong> We&rsquo;ve added new theme colors (but not in <code>$theme-colors</code>) for a more nuanced, system-wide color palette with new secondary, tertiary, and emphasis colors for <code>color</code> and <code>background-color</code>. These new colors are available as Sass variables, CSS variables, and utilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We&rsquo;ve also expanded our theme color Sass variables, CSS variables, and utilities to include text emphasis, subtle background colors, and subtle border colors. These are available as Sass variables, CSS variables, and utilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adds new <code>_variables-dark.scss</code> stylesheet to house dark-mode specific overrides. This stylesheet should be imported immediately after the existing <code>_variables.scss</code> file in your import stack.</p>

<p><strong>Progress bars</strong></p>

<p>The markup for <a href="/docs/5.3/components/progress/">progress bars</a> has been updated in v5.3.0. Due to the placement of <code>role</code> and various <code>aria-</code> attributes on the inner <code>.progress-bar</code> element, <strong>some screen readers were not announcing zero value progress bars</strong>. Now, <code>role=&quot;progressbar&quot;</code> and the relevant <code>aria-*</code> attributes are on the outer <code>.progress</code> element, leaving the <code>.progress-bar</code> purely for the visual presentation of the bar and optional label.</p>
<p>While we recommend adopting the new markup for improved compatibility with all screen readers, note that the legacy progress bar structure will continue to work as before.</p>

<p>Adds additional variables for alerts, <code>.btn-close</code>, and <code>.offcanvas</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>--bs-heading-color</code> variable is back with an update and dark mode support. First, we now check for a <code>null</code> value on the associated Sass variable, <code>$headings-color</code>, before trying to output the CSS variable, so by default it&rsquo;s not present in our compiled CSS. Second, we use the CSS variable with a fallback value, <code>inherit</code>, allowing the original behavior to persist, but also allowing for overrides.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Converts links to use CSS variables for styling <code>color</code>, but not <code>text-decoration</code>. Colors are now set with <code>--bs-link-color-rgb</code> and <code>--bs-link-opacity</code> as <code>rgba()</code> color, allowing you to customize the translucency with ease. The <code>a:hover</code> pseudo-class now overrides <code>--bs-link-color-rgb</code> instead of explicitly setting the <code>color</code> property.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>--bs-border-width</code> is now being used in more components for greater control over default global styling.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adds new root CSS variables for our <code>box-shadow</code>s, including <code>--bs-box-shadow</code>, <code>--bs-box-shadow-sm</code>, <code>--bs-box-shadow-lg</code>, and <code>--bs-box-shadow-inset</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Restores CSS variables for breakpoints, though we don&rsquo;t use them in our media queries as they&rsquo;re not supported. However, these can be useful in JS-specific contexts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Per the color modes update, we&rsquo;ve added new utilities for new Sass CSS variables <code>secondary</code> and <code>tertiary</code> text and background colors, plus <code>{color}-bg-subtle</code>, <code>{color}-border-subtle</code>, and <code>{color}-text-emphasis</code> for our theme colors. These new colors are available through Sass and CSS variables (but not our color maps) with the express goal of making it easier to customize across multiple colors modes like light and dark.</p>

<p><strong>Focus visible</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="badge text-bg-warning">Warning</span> We completely refactored our focus visible management.</li>
</ul>
<p>A <code>focus-visible()</code> mixin is provided to ensure a proper visible focus state. This visible focus state is defined by an outer outline and an inner box shadow. On light background, the outer outline is black and the inner box shadow is white. The latter will be invisible most of the time but is here to ensure a security on light background but that aren&rsquo;t white. On dark background, these colors are inverted.</p>
<p>We also removed the <code>:focus</code> style of our components that was mirroring the <code>:hover</code> state, as well as the transition animation.</p>
<p>Even if the generic case will be transparent for your project, please check this new behavior in your websites.</p>

<h2 id="v520">v5.2.0 <a class="anchor-link" href="#v520" aria-label="Link to this section: v5.2.0"></a></h2>
<hr class="mb-4">
<h3 id="refreshed-design">Refreshed design <a class="anchor-link" href="#refreshed-design" aria-label="Link to this section: Refreshed design"></a></h3>
<p>Boosted v5.2.0 features a subtle design update for a handful of components and properties across the project, <strong>most notably through refined <code>border-radius</code> values on buttons and form controls</strong>. Our documentation also has been updated with a new homepage and a simpler docs layout that no longer collapses sections of the sidebar.</p>
<h3 id="more-css-variables">More CSS variables <a class="anchor-link" href="#more-css-variables" aria-label="Link to this section: More CSS variables"></a></h3>
<p><strong>We&rsquo;ve updated all our components to use CSS variables.</strong> While Sass still underpins everything, each component has been updated to include CSS variables on the component base classes (e.g., <code>.btn</code>), allowing for more real-time customization of Bootstrap. In subsequent releases, we&rsquo;ll continue to expand our use of CSS variables into our layout, forms, helpers, and utilities. Read more about CSS variables in each component on their respective documentation pages.</p>
<p>Our CSS variable usage will be somewhat incomplete until Boosted 6. While we&rsquo;d love to fully implement these across the board, they do run the risk of causing breaking changes. For example, setting <code>$alert-border-width: var(--bs-border-width)</code> in our source code breaks potential Sass in your own code if you were doing <code>$alert-border-width * 2</code> for some reason.</p>
<p>As such, wherever possible, we will continue to push towards more CSS variables, but please recognize our implementation may be slightly limited in v5.</p>
<h3 id="new-_mapsscss">New <code>_maps.scss</code> <a class="anchor-link" href="#new-_mapsscss" aria-label="Link to this section: New _maps.scss"></a></h3>
<p><strong>Boosted v5.2.0 introduced a new Sass file with <code>_maps.scss</code>.</strong> It pulls out several Sass maps from <code>_variables.scss</code> to fix an issue where updates to an original map were not applied to secondary maps that extend them. For example, updates to <code>$theme-colors</code> were not being applied to other theme maps that relied on <code>$theme-colors</code>, breaking key customization workflows. In short, Sass has a limitation where once a default variable or map has been <em>used</em>, it cannot be updated. <em>There&rsquo;s a similar shortcoming with CSS variables when they&rsquo;re used to compose other CSS variables.</em></p>
<p>This is why variable customizations in Boosted have to come after <code>@import &quot;functions&quot;</code>, but before <code>@import &quot;variables&quot;</code> and the rest of our import stack. The same applies to Sass maps—you must override the defaults before they get used. The following maps have been moved to the new <code>_maps.scss</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>$theme-colors-rgb</code></li>
<li><code>$utilities-colors</code></li>
<li><code>$utilities-text</code></li>
<li><code>$utilities-text-colors</code></li>
<li><code>$utilities-bg</code></li>
<li><code>$utilities-bg-colors</code></li>
<li><code>$negative-spacers</code></li>
<li><code>$gutters</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Your custom Boosted CSS builds should now look something like this with a separate maps import.</p>

<ul>
<li>Expanded <a href="/docs/5.3/utilities/text/#font-weight-and-italics"><code>font-weight</code> utilities</a> to include <code>.fw-semibold</code> for semibold fonts.</li>
<li>Expanded <a href="/docs/5.3/utilities/borders/#sizes"><code>border-radius</code> utilities</a> to include two new sizes, <code>.rounded-4</code> and <code>.rounded-5</code>, for more options.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="additional-changes">Additional changes <a class="anchor-link" href="#additional-changes" aria-label="Link to this section: Additional changes"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Introduced new <code>$enable-container-classes</code> option. —</strong> Now when opting into the experimental CSS Grid layout, <code>.container-*</code> classes will still be compiled, unless this option is set to <code>false</code>. Containers also now keep their gutter values.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Offcanvas component now has <a href="/docs/5.3/components/offcanvas/#responsive">responsive variations</a>.</strong> The original <code>.offcanvas</code> class remains unchanged—it hides content across all viewports. To make it responsive, change that <code>.offcanvas</code> class to any <code>.offcanvas-{sm|md|lg|xl|xxl}</code> class.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Thicker table dividers are now opt-in. —</strong> We&rsquo;ve removed the thicker and more difficult to override border between table groups and moved it to an optional class you can apply, <code>.table-group-divider</code>. <a href="/docs/5.3/content/tables/#table-group-dividers">See the table docs for an example.</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/pull/33421">Scrollspy has been rewritten</a> to use the Intersection Observer API</strong>, which means you no longer need relative parent wrappers, deprecates <code>offset</code> config, and more. Look for your Scrollspy implementations to be more accurate and consistent in their nav highlighting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Popovers and tooltips now use CSS variables.</strong> Some CSS variables have been updated from their Sass counterparts to reduce the number of variables. As a result, three variables have been deprecated in this release: <code>$popover-arrow-color</code>, <code>$popover-arrow-outer-color</code>, and <code>$tooltip-arrow-color</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Added new <code>.text-bg-{color}</code> helpers.</strong> Instead of setting individual <code>.text-*</code> and <code>.bg-*</code> utilities, you can now use <a href="/docs/5.3/helpers/color-background/">the <code>.text-bg-*</code> helpers</a> to set a <code>background-color</code> with contrasting foreground <code>color</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added <code>.form-check-reverse</code> modifier to flip the order of labels and associated checkboxes/radios.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added <a href="/docs/5.3/content/tables/#striped-columns">striped columns</a> support to tables via the new <code>.table-striped-columns</code> class.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="badge text-bg-danger">Breaking</span> Changed <code>data-o-label</code> to <code>data-bs-label</code> in Back to top component.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="badge text-bg-danger">Breaking</span> Re-introduced footer component by tweaking a bit the classes: replaced <code>.o-footer-*</code> by <code>.footer-*</code>.</p>
</li>

<h2 id="v510">v5.1.0 <a class="anchor-link" href="#v510" aria-label="Link to this section: v5.1.0"></a></h2>
<hr class="mb-4">
<ul>
<li>
<p><span class="badge text-bg-danger">Breaking</span> Changed the behavior of <code>.bg-success</code>, <code>.bg-danger</code>, <code>.bg-warning</code> and <code>.bg-info</code>. You may prefer to use <code>.bg-supporting-green</code>, <code>.bg-supporting-pink</code>, <code>.bg-supporting-yellow</code> and <code>.bg-supporting-blue</code> instead (apart from badges). <code>$supporting-colors</code> is replaced by <code>$background-colors</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Added experimental support for <a href="/docs/5.3/layout/css-grid/">CSS Grid layout</a>. —</strong> This is a work in progress, and is not yet ready for production use, but you can opt into the new feature via Sass. To enable it, disable the default grid, by setting <code>$enable-grid-classes: false</code> and enable the CSS Grid by setting <code>$enable-cssgrid: true</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Updated navbars to support offcanvas. —</strong> Add <a href="/docs/5.3/components/navbar/#offcanvas">offcanvas drawers in any navbar</a> with the responsive <code>.navbar-expand-*</code> classes and some offcanvas markup.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Added new <a href="/docs/5.3/components/placeholders/">placeholder component</a>. —</strong> Our newest component, a way to provide temporary blocks in lieu of real content to help indicate that something is still loading in your site or app.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Collapse plugin now supports <a href="/docs/5.3/components/collapse/#horizontal">horizontal collapsing</a>. —</strong> Add <code>.collapse-horizontal</code> to your <code>.collapse</code> to collapse the <code>width</code> instead of the <code>height</code>. Avoid browser repainting by setting a <code>min-height</code> or <code>height</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Added new stack and vertical rule helpers. —</strong> Quickly apply multiple flexbox properties to quickly create custom layouts with <a href="/docs/5.3/helpers/stacks/">stacks</a>. Choose from horizontal (<code>.hstack</code>) and vertical (<code>.vstack</code>) stacks. Add vertical dividers similar to <code>&lt;hr&gt;</code> elements with the <a href="/docs/5.3/helpers/vertical-rule/">new <code>.vr</code> helpers</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Added new global <code>:root</code> CSS variables. —</strong> Added several new CSS variables to the <code>:root</code> level for controlling <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> styles. More are in the works, including across our utilities and components, but for now read up <a href="/docs/5.3/customize/css-variables/">CSS variables in the Customize section</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Overhauled color and background utilities to use CSS variables, and added new <a href="/docs/5.3/utilities/text/#opacity">text opacity</a> and <a href="/docs/5.3/utilities/background/#opacity">background opacity</a> utilities. —</strong> <code>.text-*</code> and <code>.bg-*</code> utilities are now built with CSS variables and <code>rgba()</code> color values, allowing you to easily customize any utility with new opacity utilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Added new snippet examples based to show how to customize our components. —</strong> Pull ready to use customized components and other common design patterns with our new <a href="/docs/5.3/examples/#snippets">Snippets examples</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Removed unused positioning styles from popovers and tooltips</strong> as these are handled solely by Popper. <code>$tooltip-margin</code> has been deprecated and set to <code>null</code> in the process.</p>
</li>

<h3 id="sass">Sass <a class="anchor-link" href="#sass" aria-label="Link to this section: Sass"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We&rsquo;ve ditched the default Sass map merges to make it easier to remove redundant values. Keep in mind you now have to define all values in the Sass maps like <code>$theme-colors</code>. Check out how to deal with <a href="/docs/5.3/customize/sass/#maps-and-loops">Sass maps</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="badge text-bg-danger">Breaking</span> Renamed <code>$orange-2</code> to <code>$accessible-orange</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="badge text-bg-danger">Breaking</span> Removed <code>$container-fluid-margin-widths</code>. Please use <code>$container-fluid-margin</code> instead.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="badge text-bg-danger">Breaking</span> Renamed <code>color-yiq()</code> function and related variables to <code>color-contrast()</code> as it&rsquo;s no longer related to YIQ color space. <a href="https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/pull/30168/">See #30168.</a></p>
<ul>
<li><code>$yiq-contrasted-threshold</code> is renamed to <code>$min-contrast-ratio</code>.</li>
<li><code>$yiq-text-dark</code> and <code>$yiq-text-light</code> are respectively renamed to <code>$color-contrast-dark</code> and <code>$color-contrast-light</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="badge text-bg-danger">Breaking</span> Media query mixins parameters have changed for a more logical approach.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>media-breakpoint-down()</code> uses the breakpoint itself instead of the next breakpoint (e.g., <code>media-breakpoint-down(lg)</code> instead of <code>media-breakpoint-down(md)</code> targets viewports smaller than <code>lg</code>).</li>
<li>Similarly, the second parameter in <code>media-breakpoint-between()</code> also uses the breakpoint itself instead of the next breakpoint (e.g., <code>media-breakpoint-between(sm, lg)</code> instead of <code>media-breakpoint-between(sm, md)</code> targets viewports between <code>sm</code> and <code>lg</code>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="badge text-bg-danger">Breaking</span> Removed print styles and <code>$enable-print-styles</code> variable. Print display classes are still around. <a href="https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/pull/28339">See #28339</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="badge text-bg-danger">Breaking</span> Dropped <code>color()</code>, <code>theme-color()</code>, and <code>gray()</code> functions in favor of variables. <a href="https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/pull/29083">See #29083</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="badge text-bg-danger">Breaking</span> Renamed <code>theme-color-level()</code> function to <code>color-level()</code> and now accepts any color you want instead of only <code>$theme-color</code> colors. <a href="https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/pull/29083">See #29083</a> <strong>Watch out:</strong> <code>color-level()</code> was later on dropped in <code>v5.0.0-alpha3</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="badge text-bg-danger">Breaking</span> Renamed <code>$enable-prefers-reduced-motion-media-query</code> and <code>$enable-pointer-cursor-for-buttons</code> to <code>$enable-reduced-motion</code> and <code>$enable-button-pointers</code> for brevity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="badge text-bg-danger">Breaking</span> Removed the <code>bg-gradient-variant()</code> mixin. Use the <code>.bg-gradient</code> class to add gradients to elements instead of the generated <code>.bg-gradient-*</code> classes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="badge text-bg-danger">Breaking</span> <strong>Removed previously deprecated mixins:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><code>hover</code>, <code>hover-focus</code>, <code>plain-hover-focus</code>, and <code>hover-focus-active</code></li>
<li><code>float()</code></li>
<li><code>form-control-mixin()</code></li>
<li><code>nav-divider()</code></li>
<li><code>retina-img()</code></li>
<li><code>text-hide()</code> (also dropped the associated utility class, <code>.text-hide</code>)</li>
<li><code>visibility()</code></li>
<li><code>form-control-focus()</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="badge text-bg-danger">Breaking</span> Renamed <code>scale-color()</code> function to <code>shift-color()</code> to avoid collision with Sass&rsquo;s own color scaling function.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>box-shadow</code> mixins now allow <code>null</code> values and drop <code>none</code> from multiple arguments. <a href="https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/pull/30394">See #30394</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>border-radius()</code> mixin now has a default value.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="color-system">Color system <a class="anchor-link" href="#color-system" aria-label="Link to this section: Color system"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The color system which worked with <code>color-level()</code> and <code>$theme-color-interval</code> was removed in favor of a new color system. All <code>lighten()</code> and <code>darken()</code> functions in our codebase are replaced by <code>tint-color()</code> and <code>shade-color()</code>. These functions will mix the color with either white or black instead of changing its lightness by a fixed amount. The <code>shift-color()</code> will either tint or shade a color depending on whether its weight parameter is positive or negative. <a href="https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/pull/30622">See #30622</a> for more details.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added new tints and shades for every color, providing nine separate colors for each base color, as new Sass variables.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improved color contrast. Bumped color contrast ratio from 3:1 to 4.5:1 and updated blue, green, cyan, and pink colors to ensure WCAG 2.1 AA contrast. Also changed our color contrast color from <code>$gray-900</code> to <code>$black</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To support our color system, we&rsquo;ve added new custom <code>tint-color()</code> and <code>shade-color()</code> functions to mix our colors appropriately.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="grid-updates">Grid updates <a class="anchor-link" href="#grid-updates" aria-label="Link to this section: Grid updates"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>New breakpoint!</strong> Added new <code>xxl</code> breakpoint for <code>1400px</code> and up. No changes to all other breakpoints.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Improved gutters.</strong> Gutters are now set in rems, and are narrower than v4 (<code>1.5rem</code>, or about <code>24px</code>, down from <code>30px</code>). This aligns our grid system&rsquo;s gutters with our spacing utilities.</p>
<ul>
<li>Added new <a href="/docs/5.3/layout/gutters/">gutter class</a> (<code>.g-*</code>, <code>.gx-*</code>, and <code>.gy-*</code>) to control horizontal/vertical gutters, horizontal gutters, and vertical gutters.</li>
<li><span class="badge text-bg-danger">Breaking</span> Renamed <code>.no-gutters</code> to <code>.g-0</code> to match new gutter utilities.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="badge text-bg-danger">Breaking</span> Removed <code>.text-hide</code> as it&rsquo;s an antiquated method for hiding text that shouldn&rsquo;t be used anymore.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added <code>.fs-*</code> utilities for <code>font-size</code> utilities (with RFS enabled). These use the same scale as HTML&rsquo;s default headings (1-6, large to small), and can be modified via Sass map.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="badge text-bg-danger">Breaking</span> Renamed <code>.font-weight-*</code> utilities as <code>.fw-*</code> for brevity and consistency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="badge text-bg-danger">Breaking</span> Renamed <code>.font-italic</code> utility to <code>.fst-italic</code> for brevity and consistency with new <code>.fst-normal</code> utility.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added <code>.d-grid</code> to display utilities and new <code>gap</code> utilities (<code>.gap</code>) for CSS Grid and flexbox layouts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="badge text-bg-danger">Breaking</span> Removed <code>.rounded-sm</code> and <code>rounded-lg</code>, and introduced a new scale of classes, <code>.rounded-0</code> to <code>.rounded-3</code>. <a href="https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/pull/31687">See #31687</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added new <code>line-height</code> utilities: <code>.lh-1</code>, <code>.lh-sm</code>, <code>.lh-base</code> and <code>.lh-lg</code>. See <a href="/docs/5.3/utilities/text/#line-height">here</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Moved the <code>.d-none</code> utility in our CSS to give it more weight over other display utilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Extended the <code>.visually-hidden-focusable</code> helper to also work on containers, using <code>:focus-within</code>.</p>
</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p><span class="badge text-bg-danger">Breaking</span> <strong>Responsive embed helpers have been renamed to <a href="/docs/5.3/helpers/ratio/">ratio helpers</a></strong> with new class names and improved behaviors, as well as a helpful CSS variable.</p>
<ul>
<li>Classes have been renamed to change <code>by</code> to <code>x</code> in the aspect ratio. For example, <code>.ratio-16by9</code> is now <code>.ratio-16x9</code>.</li>
<li>We&rsquo;ve dropped the <code>.embed-responsive-item</code> and element group selector in favor of a simpler <code>.ratio &gt; *</code> selector. No more class is needed, and the ratio helper now works with any HTML element.</li>
<li>The <code>$embed-responsive-aspect-ratios</code> Sass map has been renamed to <code>$aspect-ratios</code> and its values have been simplified to include the class name and the percentage as the <code>key: value</code> pair.</li>
<li>CSS variables are now generated and included for each value in the Sass map. Modify the <code>--bs-aspect-ratio</code> variable on the <code>.ratio</code> to create any <a href="/docs/5.3/helpers/ratio/#custom-ratios">custom aspect ratio</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="badge text-bg-danger">Breaking</span> <strong>&ldquo;Screen reader&rdquo; classes are now <a href="/docs/5.3/helpers/visually-hidden/">&ldquo;visually hidden&rdquo; classes</a>.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Changed the Sass file from <code>scss/helpers/_screenreaders.scss</code> to <code>scss/helpers/_visually-hidden.scss</code></li>
<li>Renamed <code>.sr-only</code> and <code>.sr-only-focusable</code> to <code>.visually-hidden</code> and <code>.visually-hidden-focusable</code></li>
<li>Renamed <code>sr-only()</code> and <code>sr-only-focusable()</code> mixins to <code>visually-hidden()</code> and <code>visually-hidden-focusable()</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>boosted-utilities.css</code> now also includes our helpers. Helpers don&rsquo;t need to be imported in custom builds anymore.</p>

<h3 id="javascript">JavaScript <a class="anchor-link" href="#javascript" aria-label="Link to this section: JavaScript"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Dropped jQuery dependency</strong> and rewrote plugins to be in regular JavaScript.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="badge text-bg-danger">Breaking</span> Data attributes for all JavaScript plugins are now namespaced to help distinguish Boosted functionality from third parties and your own code. For example, we use <code>data-bs-toggle</code> instead of <code>data-toggle</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>All plugins can now accept a CSS selector as the first argument.</strong> You can either pass a DOM element or any valid CSS selector to create a new instance of the plugin:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="kr">const</span> <span class="nx">modal</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nx">boosted</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">Modal</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;#myModal&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>

</span></span></code></pre></div></li>
<li>
<p><code>popperConfig</code> can be passed as a function that accepts the Boosted&rsquo;s default Popper config as an argument, so that you can merge this default configuration in your way. <strong>Applies to dropdowns, popovers, and tooltips.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The default value for the <code>fallbackPlacements</code> is changed to <code>['top', 'right', 'bottom', 'left']</code> for better placement of Popper elements. <strong>Applies to dropdowns, popovers, and tooltips.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Removed underscore from public static methods like <code>_getInstance()</code> → <code>getInstance()</code>.</p>
