<h2 id="direction">Direction<a class="anchor-link" aria-label="Link to this section: Direction" href="#direction"> </a></h2>
<p>Set the direction of flex items in a flex container with direction utilities. In most cases you can omit the horizontal class here as the browser default is <code>row</code>. However, you may encounter situations where you needed to explicitly set this value (like responsive layouts).</p>
<p>Use <code>.flex-row</code> to set a horizontal direction (the browser default), or <code>.flex-row-reverse</code> to start the horizontal direction from the opposite side.</p>
