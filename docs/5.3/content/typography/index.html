<p>Boosted sets basic global display, typography, and link styles. Please refer to <a href="https://oran.ge/dsweb"><strong>our brand</strong></a> to use it carefully. When more control is needed, check out the <a href="/docs/5.3/utilities/text">textual utility classes</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Use <strong>Helvetica Neue</strong>, with Helvetica and Arial as preferred fallback.</li>
<li>Then a <a href="/docs/5.3/content/reboot#native-font-stack">native font stack</a> that selects the best <code>font-family</code> for each OS and device.</li>
<li>For a more inclusive and accessible type scale, we use the browser’s default root <code>font-size</code> (typically 16px) so visitors can customize their browser defaults as needed.</li>
<li>Use the <code>$font-family-base</code>, <code>$font-size-base</code>, <code>$line-height-base</code> and <code>$letter-spacing-base</code> attributes as our typographic base applied to the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>.</li>
<li>Set the global link color via <code>$link-color</code>.</li>
<li>Use <code>$body-bg</code> to set a <code>background-color</code> on the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> (<code>#fff</code> by default).</li>
</ul>
<p>These styles can be found within <code>_reboot.scss</code>, and the global variables are defined in <code>_variables.scss</code>. Make sure to set <code>$font-size-base</code> in <code>rem</code>.</p>

<p>Beware that those tags should be used for semantic purpose:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>&lt;mark&gt;</code> represents text which is marked or highlighted for reference or notation purposes.</li>
<li><code>&lt;small&gt;</code> represents side-comments and small print, like copyright and legal text.</li>
<li><code>&lt;s&gt;</code> represents element that are no longer relevant or no longer accurate.</li>
<li><code>&lt;u&gt;</code> represents a span of inline text which should be rendered in a way that indicates that it has a non-textual annotation.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to style your text, you should use the following classes instead:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>.mark</code> will apply the same styles as <code>&lt;mark&gt;</code>.</li>
<li><code>.small</code> will apply the same styles as <code>&lt;small&gt;</code>.</li>
<li><code>.text-decoration-underline</code> will apply the same styles as <code>&lt;u&gt;</code>.</li>
<li><code>.text-decoration-line-through</code> will apply the same styles as <code>&lt;s&gt;</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>While not shown above, feel free to use <code>&lt;b&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> in HTML5. <code>&lt;b&gt;</code> is meant to highlight words or phrases without conveying additional importance, while <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> is mostly for voice, technical terms, etc.</p>
