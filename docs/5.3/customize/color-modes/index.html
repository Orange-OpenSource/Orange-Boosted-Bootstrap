<p><strong>Boosted now supports color modes, starting with dark mode!</strong> With v5.3.3 you can implement your own color mode toggler (see below for an example from Boosted&rsquo;s docs) and apply the different color modes as you see fit. We support a light mode (default) and now dark mode. Color modes can be toggled globally on the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element, or on specific components and elements, thanks to the <code>data-bs-theme</code> attribute.</p>
<p>This <code>data-bs-theme</code> attribute will automatically apply the corresponding <code>color</code> and <code>background-color</code> properties of the targeted element.</p>

<div class="bd-callout bd-callout-warning">
<p>Applying a color mode directly on a component or element (especially with some basic HTML elements, form controls, etc.), some unexpected rendering may occur. It is mostly related to the automatic change of <code>color</code> and <code>background-color</code> properties linked to the color mode.</p>
<p>Most of the time, the workaround will be to add a <code>data-bs-theme</code> attribute on the parent element of the component or element you want to apply a color mode to.</p>

</div>

<p>Alternatively, you can also switch to a media query implementation thanks to our color mode mixin—see <a href="#building-with-sass">the usage section for details</a>. Heads up though—this eliminates your ability to change themes on a per-component basis as shown below.</p>
<h3 id="contextual-dark-mode-vs-dark-variants">Contextual dark mode vs. dark variants <a class="anchor-link" href="#contextual-dark-mode-vs-dark-variants" aria-label="Link to this section: Contextual dark mode vs. dark variants"></a></h3>
<p>Before v5.3.3, Boosted had dark variants for some components by applying <code>.{component}-dark</code> classes. These classes don&rsquo;t exist anymore and have been replaced by contextual dark mode. This means that all components will automatically switch to dark mode when the <code>data-bs-theme</code> attribute is set to <code>dark</code> on the parent element or the component itself.</p>
<h2 id="example">Example <a class="anchor-link" href="#example" aria-label="Link to this section: Example"></a></h2>
<p>For example, to change the color mode of a dropdown, add <code>data-bs-theme=&quot;light&quot;</code> or <code>data-bs-theme=&quot;dark&quot;</code> to the parent <code>.dropdown</code>. Now, no matter the global color mode, these dropdowns will display with the specified theme value.</p>

<p>As shown above, color mode styles are controlled by the <code>data-bs-theme</code> attribute. This attribute can be applied to the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element, or to any other element or Boosted component. If applied to the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element, it will apply to everything. If applied to a component or element, it will be scoped to that specific component or element.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For each color mode you wish to support, you&rsquo;ll need to add new overrides for the shared global CSS variables. We do this already in our <code>_root.scss</code> stylesheet for dark mode, with light mode being the default values. In writing color mode specific styles, use the mixin:</p>

<p>We use a custom <code>_variables-dark.scss</code> to power those shared global CSS variable overrides for dark mode. This file isn&rsquo;t required for your own custom color modes, but it&rsquo;s required for our dark mode for two reasons. First, it&rsquo;s better to have a single place to reset global colors. Second, some Sass variables had to be overridden for background images embedded in our CSS for accordions, form components, and more.</p>

<p>Enable the built in dark color mode across your entire project by adding the <code>data-bs-theme=&quot;dark&quot;</code> attribute to the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element. This will apply the dark color mode to all components and elements, other than those with a specific <code>data-bs-theme</code> attribute applied.

<p>Our new dark mode option is available to use for all users of Boosted, but it&rsquo;s controlled via data attributes instead of media queries and does not automatically toggle your project&rsquo;s color mode. You can disable our dark mode entirely via Sass by changing <code>$enable-dark-mode</code> to <code>false</code>.</p>
<div class="bd-callout bd-callout-warning">
<p>Please be aware that some of Boosted&rsquo;s components always use the contextual dark mode to have the same rendering both in light and dark mode, such as our <a href="/docs/5.3/components/orange-navbar/">Orange navbar</a> and <a href="/docs/5.3/components/footer/">Footer</a>.</p>
<p>If you need to use them, you won&rsquo;t be able to disable the dark mode globally.</p>

</div>

<p>We use a custom Sass mixin, <code>color-mode()</code>, to help you control <em>how</em> color modes are applied. By default, we use a <code>data</code> attribute approach, allowing you to create more user-friendly experiences where your visitors can choose to have an automatic dark mode or control their preference (like in our own docs here). This is also an easy and scalable way to add different themes and more custom color modes beyond light and dark.</p>
<p>In case you want to use media queries and only make color modes automatic, you can change the mixin&rsquo;s default type via Sass variable. Consider the following snippet and its compiled CSS output.</p>

<p>While the primary use case for color modes is light and dark mode, custom color modes are also possible. Create your own <code>data-bs-theme</code> selector with a custom value as the name of your color mode, then modify our Sass and CSS variables as needed. We opted to create a separate <code>_variables-dark.scss</code> stylesheet to house Boosted&rsquo;s dark mode specific Sass variables, but that&rsquo;s not required for you.</p>
<p>For example, you can create a &ldquo;blue theme&rdquo; with the selector <code>data-bs-theme=&quot;blue&quot;</code>. In your custom Sass or CSS file, add the new selector and override any global or component CSS variables as needed. If you&rsquo;re using Sass, you can also use Sass&rsquo;s functions within your CSS variable overrides.</p>

<p>To allow visitors or users to toggle color modes, you&rsquo;ll need to create a toggle element to control the <code>data-bs-theme</code> attribute on the root element, <code>&lt;html&gt;</code>. We&rsquo;ve built a toggler in our documentation that initially defers to a user&rsquo;s current system color mode, but provides an option to override that and pick a specific color mode.</p>
<div class="bd-callout bd-callout-info">
Check out our <a href="/docs/5.3/components/orange-navbar/#with-mode-selector">Orange navbar mode selector variant</a> to add a color mode selector to your navbar.
</div>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a look at the JavaScript that powers it. Feel free to inspect our own documentation navbar to see how it&rsquo;s implemented using HTML and CSS from our own components. It is suggested to include the JavaScript at the top of your page to reduce potential screen flickering during reloading of your site. Note that if you decide to use media queries for your color modes, your JavaScript may need to be modified or removed if you prefer an implicit control.</p>

<h2 id="adding-theme-colors">Adding theme colors <a class="anchor-link" href="#adding-theme-colors" aria-label="Link to this section: Adding theme colors"></a></h2>
<p>Adding a new color in <code>$theme-colors</code> is not enough for some of our components like <a href="/docs/5.3/components/alerts/">alerts</a> and <a href="/docs/5.3/components/list-group/">list groups</a>. New colors must also be defined in <code>$theme-colors-text</code>, <code>$theme-colors-bg-subtle</code>, and <code>$theme-colors-border-subtle</code> for light theme; but also in <code>$theme-colors-text-dark</code>, <code>$theme-colors-bg-subtle-dark</code>, and <code>$theme-colors-border-subtle-dark</code> for dark theme.</p>
<p>This is a manual process because Sass cannot generate its own Sass variables from an existing variable or map. In future versions of Boosted, we&rsquo;ll revisit this setup to reduce the duplication.</p>
