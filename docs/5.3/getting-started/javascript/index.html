<p>Plugins can be included individually (using Boosted’s individual <code>js/dist/*.js</code>), or all at once using <code>boosted.js</code> or the minified <code>boosted.min.js</code> (don’t include both).</p>
<p>If you use a bundler (Webpack, Parcel, Vite...), you can use <code>/js/dist/*.js</code> files which are UMD ready.</p>
<h2 id="usage-with-javascript-frameworks">Usage with JavaScript frameworks<a class="anchor-link" href="#usage-with-javascript-frameworks"><span class="visually-hidden">Link to this section: Usage with JavaScript frameworks</span></a></h2>
<p>While the Boosted CSS can be used with any framework, <strong>the Boosted JavaScript is not fully compatible with JavaScript frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular</strong> which assume full knowledge of the DOM. Both Boosted and the framework may attempt to mutate the same DOM element, resulting in bugs like dropdowns that are stuck in the “open” position.</p>
<p>A better alternative for those using this type of frameworks is to use a framework-specific package <strong>instead of</strong> the Boosted JavaScript. Here are some of the most popular options:</p>
<ul>
<li>React: <a href="https://react-bootstrap.github.io/">React Bootstrap</a>
<div class="bd-callout bd-callout-info"> <p><strong>Try it yourself!</strong> Download the source code and working demo for using Bootstrap with React, Next.js, and React Bootstrap from the <a href="https://github.com/twbs/examples/tree/main/react-nextjs">twbs/examples repository</a>.

<div class="bd-callout bd-callout-info"> <p><strong>To get a working Boosted demo based on the Bootstrap ones</strong>, you need to replace all <code>bootstrap</code> occurrences with <code>boosted</code> in <code>scss/style.scss</code>, within <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags in<code>index.html</code> and in <code>package.json</code>.</p><p>You may need to tweak a bit <code>scss/style.scss</code> to import font family properly in your project.

<p>We provide a version of Boosted built as <code>ESM</code> (<code>boosted.esm.js</code> and <code>boosted.esm.min.js</code>) which allows you to use Boosted as a module in the browser, if your <a href="https://caniuse.com/es6-module">targeted browsers support it</a>.</p>

<p>Compared to JS bundlers, using ESM in the browser requires you to use the full path and filename instead of the module name. <a href="https://v8.dev/features/modules#specifiers">Read more about JS modules in the browser.</a> That’s why we use <code>&#39;boosted.esm.min.js&#39;</code> instead of <code>&#39;boosted&#39;</code> above. However, this is further complicated by our Popper dependency, which imports Popper into our JavaScript like so:</p>
 <div class="bd-code-snippet">  <div class="highlight"> <pre class="language-js"><code is:raw class="language-js"><span class="token keyword">import</span> <span class="token operator">*</span> <span class="token keyword">as</span> Popper <span class="token keyword">from</span> <span class="token string">&quot;@popperjs/core&quot;</span>
</code></pre> </div> <div class="bd-clipboard"> <button type="button" class="btn-clipboard" title="Copy to clipboard"> <svg class="bi" role="img" aria-label="Copy"> <use xlink:href="#clipboard"></use> </svg> </button> </div> </div>
<p>If you try this as-is, you’ll see an error in the console like the following:</p>
 <div class="bd-code-snippet">  <div class="highlight"> <pre class="language-text"><code is:raw class="language-text">Uncaught TypeError: Failed to resolve module specifier &quot;@popperjs/core&quot;. Relative references must start with either &quot;/&quot;, &quot;./&quot;, or &quot;../&quot;.

<p>To fix this, you can use an <code>importmap</code> to resolve the arbitrary module names to complete paths. If your <a href="https://caniuse.com/?search=importmap">targeted browsers</a> do not support <code>importmap</code>, you’ll need to use the <a href="https://github.com/guybedford/es-module-shims">es-module-shims</a> project.

<h2 id="dependencies">Dependencies<a class="anchor-link" href="#dependencies"><span class="visually-hidden">Link to this section: Dependencies</span></a></h2>
<p>Some plugins and CSS components depend on other plugins. If you include plugins individually, make sure to check for these dependencies in the docs.</p>
<p>Our dropdowns, popovers, and tooltips also depend on <a href="https://popper.js.org/docs/v2/">Popper</a>.</p>
<h2 id="data-attributes">Data attributes<a class="anchor-link" href="#data-attributes"><span class="visually-hidden">Link to this section: Data attributes</span></a></h2>
<p>Nearly all Boosted plugins can be enabled and configured through HTML alone with data attributes (our preferred way of using JavaScript functionality). Be sure to <strong>only use one set of data attributes on a single element</strong> (e.g., you cannot trigger a tooltip and modal from the same button.)</p>
<p>As options can be passed via data attributes or JavaScript, you can append an option name to <code>data-bs-</code>, as in <code>data-bs-animation=&quot;{value}&quot;</code>. Make sure to change the case type of the option name from “<em>camelCase</em>” to “<em>kebab-case</em>” when passing the options via data attributes. For example, use <code>data-bs-custom-class=&quot;beautifier&quot;</code> instead of <code>data-bs-customClass=&quot;beautifier&quot;</code>.</p>
<p>As of Boosted 5.2.0, all components support an <strong>experimental</strong> reserved data attribute <code>data-bs-config</code> that can house simple component configuration as a JSON string. When an element has <code>data-bs-config=&#39;{&quot;delay&quot;:0, &quot;title&quot;:123}&#39;</code> and <code>data-bs-title=&quot;456&quot;</code> attributes, the final <code>title</code> value will be <code>456</code> and the separate data attributes will override values given on <code>data-bs-config</code>. In addition, existing data attributes are able to house JSON values like <code>data-bs-delay=&#39;{&quot;show&quot;:0,&quot;hide&quot;:150}&#39;</code>.</p>
<p>The final configuration object is the merged result of <code>data-bs-config</code>, <code>data-bs-</code>, and <code>js object</code> where the latest given key-value overrides the others.</p>
<h2 id="selectors">Selectors<a class="anchor-link" href="#selectors"><span class="visually-hidden">Link to this section: Selectors</span></a></h2>
<p>We use the native <code>querySelector</code> and <code>querySelectorAll</code> methods to query DOM elements for performance reasons, so you must use <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/syndata.html#value-def-identifier">valid selectors</a>. If you use special selectors like <code>collapse:Example</code>, be sure to escape them.</p>
<h2 id="events">Events<a class="anchor-link" href="#events"><span class="visually-hidden">Link to this section: Events</span></a></h2>
<p>Boosted provides custom events for most plugins’ unique actions. Generally, these come in an infinitive and past participle form - where the infinitive (ex. <code>show</code>) is triggered at the start of an event, and its past participle form (ex. <code>shown</code>) is triggered on the completion of an action.</p>
<p>All infinitive events provide <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/preventDefault"><code>preventDefault()</code></a> functionality. This provides the ability to stop the execution of an action before it starts. Returning false from an event handler will also automatically call <code>preventDefault()</code>.</p>

<p>If you’d like to get a particular plugin instance, each plugin exposes a <code>getInstance</code> method. For example, to retrieve an instance directly from an element:</p>
 <div class="bd-code-snippet">  <div class="highlight"> <pre class="language-js"><code is:raw class="language-js">boosted<span class="token punctuation">.</span>Popover<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">getInstance</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>myPopoverEl<span class="token punctuation">)</span>

<p>This method will return <code>null</code> if an instance is not initiated over the requested element.</p>
<p>Alternatively, <code>getOrCreateInstance</code> can be used to get the instance associated with a DOM element, or create a new one in case it wasn’t initialized.</p>
 <div class="bd-code-snippet">  <div class="highlight"> <pre class="language-js"><code is:raw class="language-js">boosted<span class="token punctuation">.</span>Popover<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">getOrCreateInstance</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>myPopoverEl<span class="token punctuation">,</span> configObject<span class="token punctuation">)</span>

<p>In case an instance wasn’t initialized, it may accept and use an optional configuration object as second argument.</p>

<p>Sometimes it is necessary to use Boosted plugins with other UI frameworks. In these circumstances, namespace collisions can occasionally occur. If this happens, you may call <code>.noConflict</code> on the plugin you wish to revert the value of.</p>

<p>Boosted does not officially support third-party JavaScript libraries like Prototype or jQuery UI. Despite <code>.noConflict</code> and namespaced events, there may be compatibility problems that you need to fix on your own.</p>
<h3 id="jquery-events">jQuery events<a class="anchor-link" href="#jquery-events"><span class="visually-hidden">Link to this section: jQuery events</span></a></h3>
<p>Boosted will detect jQuery if <code>jQuery</code> is present in the <code>window</code> object and there is no <code>data-bs-no-jquery</code> attribute set on <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>. If jQuery is found, Boosted will emit events thanks to jQuery’s event system. So if you want to listen to Boosted’s events, you’ll have to use the jQuery methods (<code>.on</code>, <code>.one</code>) instead of <code>addEventListener</code>.</p>
