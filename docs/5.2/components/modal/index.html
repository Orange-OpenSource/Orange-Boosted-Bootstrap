<p>Before getting started with Boosted&rsquo;s modal component, be sure to read the following as our menu options have recently changed.</p>
<ul>
<li>Modals are built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. They&rsquo;re positioned over everything else in the document and remove scroll from the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> so that modal content scrolls instead.</li>
<li>Clicking on the modal &ldquo;backdrop&rdquo; will automatically close the modal.</li>
<li>Boosted only supports one modal window at a time. Nested modals aren&rsquo;t supported as we believe them to be poor user experiences.</li>
<li>Modals use <code>position: fixed</code>, which can sometimes be a bit particular about its rendering. Whenever possible, place your modal HTML in a top-level position to avoid potential interference from other elements. You&rsquo;ll likely run into issues when nesting a <code>.modal</code> within another fixed element.</li>
<li>Once again, due to <code>position: fixed</code>, there are some caveats with using modals on mobile devices. <a href="/docs/5.2/getting-started/browsers-devices/#modals-and-dropdowns-on-mobile">See our browser support docs</a> for details.</li>
<li>Due to how HTML5 defines its semantics, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#attr-autofocus">the <code>autofocus</code> HTML attribute</a> has no effect in Boosted modals. To achieve the same effect, use some custom JavaScript:</li>
</ul>

In the above static example, we use <code>&lt;h5&gt;</code>, to avoid issues with the heading hierarchy in the documentation page. Structurally, however, a modal dialog represents its own separate document/context, so the <code>.modal-title</code> should ideally be an <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>. If necessary, you can use the <a href="/docs/5.2/utilities/text/#font-size">font size utilities</a> to control the heading&rsquo;s appearance. All the following live examples use this approach.

<p>The <code>$modal-fade-transform</code> variable determines the transform state of <code>.modal-dialog</code> before the modal fade-in animation, the <code>$modal-show-transform</code> variable determines the transform of <code>.modal-dialog</code> at the end of the modal fade-in animation.</p>
<p>If you want for example a zoom-in animation, you can set <code>$modal-fade-transform: scale(.8)</code>.</p>

<h3 id="accessibility">Accessibility <a class="anchor-link" href="#accessibility" aria-label="Link to this section: Accessibility"></a></h3>
<p>Be sure to add <code>aria-labelledby=&quot;...&quot;</code>, referencing the modal title, to <code>.modal</code>. Additionally, you may give a description of your modal dialog with <code>aria-describedby</code> on <code>.modal</code>. Note that you don&rsquo;t need to add <code>role=&quot;dialog&quot;</code> since we already add it via JavaScript.</p>
<h3 id="embedding-youtube-videos">Embedding YouTube videos <a class="anchor-link" href="#embedding-youtube-videos" aria-label="Link to this section: Embedding YouTube videos"></a></h3>
<p>Embedding YouTube videos in modals requires additional JavaScript not in Boosted to automatically stop playback and more. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18622508/bootstrap-3-and-youtube-in-modal">See this helpful Stack Overflow post</a> for more information.</p>
<h2 id="optional-sizes">Optional sizes <a class="anchor-link" href="#optional-sizes" aria-label="Link to this section: Optional sizes"></a></h2>
<p>Modals have three optional sizes, available via modifier classes to be placed on a <code>.modal-dialog</code>. These sizes kick in at certain breakpoints to avoid horizontal scrollbars on narrower viewports.</p>

<h3 id="variables">Variables <a class="anchor-link" href="#variables" aria-label="Link to this section: Variables"></a></h3>

<p><span class="tag tag-sm">Added in v5.2.0</span></p>

<p>As part of Boosted&rsquo;s evolving CSS variables approach, modals now use local CSS variables on <code>.modal</code>, <code>.modal-dialog-scrollable</code> and <code>.modal-backdrop</code> for enhanced real-time customization. Values for the CSS variables are set via Sass, so Sass customization is still supported, too.</p>

<h2 id="usage">Usage <a class="anchor-link" href="#usage" aria-label="Link to this section: Usage"></a></h2>
<p>The modal plugin toggles your hidden content on demand, via data attributes or JavaScript. It also overrides default scrolling behavior and generates a <code>.modal-backdrop</code> to provide a click area for dismissing shown modals when clicking outside the modal.</p>
<h3 id="via-data-attributes">Via data attributes <a class="anchor-link" href="#via-data-attributes" aria-label="Link to this section: Via data attributes"></a></h3>
<h4 id="toggle">Toggle <a class="anchor-link" href="#toggle" aria-label="Link to this section: Toggle"></a></h4>
<p>Activate a modal without writing JavaScript. Set <code>data-bs-toggle=&quot;modal&quot;</code> on a controller element, like a button, along with a <code>data-bs-target=&quot;#foo&quot;</code> or <code>href=&quot;#foo&quot;</code> to target a specific modal to toggle.</p>

While both ways to dismiss a modal are supported, keep in mind that dismissing from outside a modal does not match the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/dialogmodal/">ARIA Authoring Practices Guide dialog (modal) pattern</a>. Do this at your own risk.

<h3 id="via-javascript">Via JavaScript <a class="anchor-link" href="#via-javascript" aria-label="Link to this section: Via JavaScript"></a></h3>

</span></span></code></pre></div><h3 id="options">Options <a class="anchor-link" href="#options" aria-label="Link to this section: Options"></a></h3>
<p>As options can be passed via data attributes or JavaScript, you can append an option name to <code>data-bs-</code>, as in <code>data-bs-animation=&quot;{value}&quot;</code>. Make sure to change the case type of the option name from &ldquo;<em>camelCase</em>&rdquo; to &ldquo;<em>kebab-case</em>&rdquo; when passing the options via data attributes. For example, use <code>data-bs-custom-class=&quot;beautifier&quot;</code> instead of <code>data-bs-customClass=&quot;beautifier&quot;</code>.</p>
<p>As of Boosted 5.2.0, all components support an <strong>experimental</strong> reserved data attribute <code>data-bs-config</code> that can house simple component configuration as a JSON string. When an element has <code>data-bs-config='{&quot;delay&quot;:0, &quot;title&quot;:123}'</code> and <code>data-bs-title=&quot;456&quot;</code> attributes, the final <code>title</code> value will be <code>456</code> and the separate data attributes will override values given on <code>data-bs-config</code>. In addition, existing data attributes are able to house JSON values like <code>data-bs-delay='{&quot;show&quot;:0,&quot;hide&quot;:150}'</code>.</p>
