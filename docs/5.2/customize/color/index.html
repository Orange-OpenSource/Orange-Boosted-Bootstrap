<p>All Boosted colors are available as Sass variables and a Sass map in <code>scss/_variables.scss</code> file. To avoid increased file sizes, we don&rsquo;t create text or background color classes for each of these variables. Instead, we choose a subset of these colors for a <a href="#theme-colors">theme palette</a>.</p>
<p>Please note that in the Boosted colors, the indigo colors are the same as the purple ones.</p>

</div>

<p>Be sure to monitor contrast ratios as you customize colors. As shown below, we&rsquo;ve added three contrast ratios to each of the main colors—one for the swatch&rsquo;s current colors, one for against white, and one for against black.</p>

<h3 id="notes-on-sass">Notes on Sass <a class="anchor-link" href="#notes-on-sass" aria-label="Link to this section: Notes on Sass"></a></h3>
<p>Sass cannot programmatically generate variables, so we manually created variables for every tint and shade ourselves. We specify the midpoint value (e.g., <code>$blue-500</code>) and use custom color functions to tint (lighten) or shade (darken) our colors via Sass&rsquo;s <code>mix()</code> color function.</p>
<p>Using <code>mix()</code> is not the same as <code>lighten()</code> and <code>darken()</code>—the former blends the specified color with white or black, while the latter only adjusts the lightness value of each color. The result is a much more complete suite of colors, as <a href="https://codepen.io/emdeoh/pen/zYOQOPB">shown in this CodePen demo</a>.</p>
<p>Our <code>tint-color()</code> and <code>shade-color()</code> functions use <code>mix()</code> alongside our <code>$theme-color-interval</code> variable, which specifies a stepped percentage value for each mixed color we produce. See the <code>scss/_functions.scss</code> and <code>scss/_variables.scss</code> files for the full source code.</p>
<h2 id="color-sass-maps">Color Sass maps <a class="anchor-link" href="#color-sass-maps" aria-label="Link to this section: Color Sass maps"></a></h2>
<p>Boosted&rsquo;s source Sass files include three maps to help you quickly and easily loop over a list of colors and their hex values.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>$colors</code> lists all our available base (<code>500</code>) colors</li>
<li><code>$theme-colors</code> lists all semantically named theme colors (shown below)</li>
<li><code>$background-colors</code> overrides <code>$theme-colors</code> specifically for usage in <code>.bg-*</code> utilities</li>
<li><code>$grays</code> lists all tints and shades of gray</li>
</ul>
<p>Within <code>scss/_variables.scss</code>, you&rsquo;ll find Boosted&rsquo;s color variables and Sass map. Here&rsquo;s an example of the <code>$colors</code> Sass map:</p>

<p>Add, remove, or modify values within the map to update how they&rsquo;re used in many other components. Unfortunately at this time, not <em>every</em> component utilizes this Sass map. Future updates will strive to improve upon this. Until then, plan on making use of the <code>${color}</code> variables and this Sass map.</p>
<h3 id="example">Example <a class="anchor-link" href="#example" aria-label="Link to this section: Example"></a></h3>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how you can use these in your Sass:</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p><a href="/docs/5.2/utilities/colors/">Color</a> and <a href="/docs/5.2/utilities/background/">background</a> utility classes are also available for setting <code>color</code> and <code>background-color</code> using the <code>500</code> color values.</p>
<h2 id="generating-utilities">Generating utilities <a class="anchor-link" href="#generating-utilities" aria-label="Link to this section: Generating utilities"></a></h2>

<p><span class="tag tag-sm">Added in v5.1.0</span></p>

<p>Boosted doesn&rsquo;t include <code>color</code> and <code>background-color</code> utilities for every color variable, but you can generate these yourself with our <a href="/docs/5.2/utilities/api/">utility API</a> and our extended Sass maps added in v5.1.0.</p>
<ol>
<li>To start, make sure you&rsquo;ve imported our functions, variables, mixins, and utilities.</li>
<li>Use our <code>map-merge-multiple()</code> function to quickly merge multiple Sass maps together in a new map.</li>
<li>Merge this new combined map to extend any utility with a <code>{color}-{level}</code> class name.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an example that generates text color utilities (e.g., <code>.text-purple-500</code>) using the above steps.</p>
